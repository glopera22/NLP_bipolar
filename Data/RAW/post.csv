50;bipolarreddit;ADHDvm;01/03/2019;"To be bipolar &amp; legally recognized as disabled or not: pros &amp; cons? I am pretty stable on meds right now and could probably pass as not having a disability. The exception is if I need to take time off in the future for breakout episodes that would put me over my vacation/sick day allowance. In that case I assume I need to use ADA accommodations. 

I was talking with my pdoc the other day and I asked about the national parks access pass for people with disabilities and she said something along the lines of I need to decide if I want to be considered legally disabled because that could bite me in the butt one day. 

I know on my job licensing application it asks if I have any conditions that affect my ability to practice veterinary medicine. I said no because I don't think that this disorder will affect my medical judgement. Anyway, I will take time off before it gets to that point. But at the same time I might need to take more time off than I have available in my contract if I have breakout episodes. But there is already an example of this potential problem.

Does anyone know the pros and cons of legally having a disability in the context of bipolar disorder?";943;44;166;20;14;304;124;222

52;bipolarreddit;adltchickadee;23/01/2019;"A sense of place Hi guys....this is a post I've been thinking of making for a while, but I have a hard time wording it. It's one of the big things I struggle with and I think it contributes to my anxiety and depression, but I don't know how to express it to others.

Here it is: I grew up in a rural area, and I hated it. When I went away to college at age 18, I moved to a suburb outside of a major city, met great new people from all over the world, explored the city even though the college is about a 30 min drive/subway ride from it. Basically.....I had fun, felt comfortable with the people around me, explored new places, and felt proud of where I was even though, to others, it was a bland suburb.

Ever since finishing college, I have been searching for that feeling again: that feeling of just being in the right spot, where I need to be. 

It's been almost 15 years since I left that area. Since then, I've lived in 3 different places, two suburbs of major cities and downtown in a mid-size city.

Everywhere I go, I long for that feeling of knowing that where I am is a perfect fit....that feeling I only had for the six years (Bachelors and Masters at the same college) I lived in that suburb, at my college.

I now live in a suburb of another major city...basically the same distance (about 30 min) away from the city, but with good public transportation so I can go to the city anytime I want...just like the suburb where I went to college. I have met a few great friends here. It is basically the same situation (suburb of a large city, good friends, good public transit to put me in the city when I want to go there).......but I almost hate it here. 

It doesn't make any sense! My husband is obsessed with buying a house here (which is a crazy fantasy bc there's no way we can afford a downpayment anytime soon, but that's a whole other issue), and I almost get panic attacks thinking about staying here for the rest of my life.

And yet, every time we move, I'm dissatisfied there, too. My husband says that if it were up to me, we'd just keep moving from place to place for the rest of our lives because whenever we end up somewhere, I immediately start talking about moving somewhere else.

On paper these places are basically the same as the place where I felt the most comfortable, but they don't feel right...in the three places I've lived since leaving that college, I've felt like a puzzle piece that just doen't fit.

I guess i'm just wondering if anyone else feels this way: a sense of never being in the place where you belong....or is this just my own anxiety that's for some reason clinging to this particular issue?

I hope this makes sense. I've been trying to explain it to my husband and a number of psychiatrists over the year, and they just don't seem to get it.";2164;69;446;25;32;701;232;556
52;bipolarreddit;adltchickadee;01/02/2018;"Happiness I feel like there's been a lot of posts on here lately about people fearing that happiness or stability will turn into hypomania. This made me think about how much it sucks that people with bipolar have to approach happiness in ways that others don't.

For the first time in years, a bunch of positive stuff is coming together for me: I'm (for the moment) financially secure, my job is challenging but not overwhelming, I have the chance to work on a really cool project, the weather is nice (where I am), I've been running again and signed up for a race, and after careful tapering, I'm down to my lowest daily dose of Klonopin in 9 years. 

For someone without bipolar, it would be obvious that this combination of things would make someone happy, and you wouldn't question that this is a great thing! But since I have bipolar, I'm already like: am I happy or am I *too* happy?

It just seems kinda unfair that we can't just be happy when nice stuff happens to us. People with unipolar depression who begin to feel less depressed have nothing to fear (unless their SSRIs make them manic and turn into one of us, mwahahaha). People who have anxiety and become less anxious--great! People with bipolar who finally reach a balance...nope! Better be on the watch for hypomania!

It just seems like we're not allowed to enjoy being happy....";1064;41;181;19;16;346;141;251
84;bipolarreddit;Aneaunymousse;03/01/2018;"Getting a bit high... escalating quickly So my psychiatrist put me on Lamictal first, then added Seroplex (SSRI) about two weeks ago.  And two days ago, I finally started getting better. Like a lot, lot better. And I feel I'm getting higher and higher as the days pass. Today I'm missing work because all I want to do is to see some friends and climb a building. I wanted to watch a TV show but I can't since I just wanna dance and sing and do something.

84;bipolarreddit;Aneaunymousse;12/02/2019;"Comorbid Anxiety? I sleep too much Hi guys,

So it's been a very long time I've been here. Some good news: meds work, like work work. Took a year and a half to stabilize but Seroplex+lamictal+solian combo did a good job. I crashed a car in August and it was the last time I've been maniac since.

But here it comes. These days I've been starting to think that hypomania was so intense and fun I feel like my life is so boring now. Plus I think I may have anxiety too. Lately I've been sleeping so much I can't even hear my alarms. I have trouble getting to sleep at night but I can sleep for hours at daytime although I had 10 hours sleep the night before. I get anxious when I have to meet friends or have a big party. I wake up a lot during the night. Monday I took 3 coffees during the morning and I had to get out of class cause I got stressed...

What do you guys think? I'm meeting my psychiatrist on Saturday.

148;bipolarreddit;beast-freak;07/01/2018;"A Revolution in the Treatment of Depression ? — A BBC article looking at the link between depression and inflammation. You can read the article here:

* http://www.bbc.com/news/health-37166293

From the article:

&gt;Inflammation is part of the immune system's response to danger. It is a hugely complicated process to prepare our body to fight off hostile forces.
If inflammation is too low then an infection can get out of hand. If it is too high, it causes damage.
&gt;
&gt;And for some reason, about one-third of depressed patients have consistently high levels of inflammation. Hayley is one of them: ""I do have raised inflammation markers, I think normal is under 0.7 and mine is 40, it's coming up regularly in blood tests.""
&gt;
&gt;There is now a patchwork quilt of evidence suggesting inflammation is more than something you simply find in some depressed patients, but is actually the cause of their disease. That the immune system can alter the workings of the brain.

Hopefully this might offer another treatment approach for those of us who mostly suffer from depression.

There is also a 30 minute BBC podcast on the subject [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07pj2pw)";958;47;128;24;15;291;124;192

161;bipolarreddit;berfica;24/03/2019;"Should I call my psychiatrist? -TRIGGER WARN- I don't know what to do. All of the sudden last Friday I took a nose dive deep deep into suicidal/harmful depression. I saw my Pdoc Thursday, when I was doing ok. 

Now I am constantly thinking of suicide. I tried to smother myself with a pillow, twice. I figured it wouldn't work, but gave it a go. Then I tried to see if I could get a gun from Amazon - spoiler alert... no you can't -. 

I was in so much mental anguish I self harmed the ""typical"" way... but that wasn't enough. I wanted to break my hand. I needed to. For three days over and over I've been beating it with a hammer. Yesterday it was as swollen as a half a golf ball. 

I haven't told anyone. I don't trust anyone. I don't want to go to the hospital again. I tried calling my therapist, but she only works 2 days a week. I'm afraid to call my doc. I don't want to waste his time, or for him to think I am just trying to get attention or something. I don't know what to do. I'm desperate for help, but I don't trust anyone. 

I've tried sooooo many treatments. Last month I finished a round of 25 ECT with Ketamine sessions. I've gone through all the drugs. Nothing helps. Nothing will ever help. I just want to be put out. And I 100% do not want to go sit in the stupid hospital. That would make 6 months in a row. ";1011;31;232;11;34;336;152;278

174;bipolarreddit;bingedown;19/01/2019;"I no longer see this as an illness I was diagnosed 4 years ago after a psychotic episode. Tried many medications to control the swings including Depakote, Lithium, Quetiapine and so on. Nothing worked and I started thinking about that. This 'illness' is not understood in any capacity. No one knows why people get it, no one knows how medication works or if it will work. The medication is proven to be severely damaging to our bodies and often meds stop working all together but are difficult to stop taking due to withdrawals. I'm not anti med in anyway, but I'm anti long term meds. No doubt medication has helped during acute episodes but keeping me on them long term did more damage to my life than good.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been volunteering, writing music, walking. If I feel depressed I accept that. I lay in bed and cry, and that's okay I think. I feel much better saying to myself 'you have extreme moods swings, experience them' rather than 'you have extreme mood swings, you need to suppress that as well as all your other emotions.'

&amp;#x200B;

 I've started looking for alternative ways to bring myself some peace. I have been off medication for two months now and have really enjoyed the lows and highs I've been experiencing. I feel more like myself, I don't have the constant sedation. I've stopped thinking 'why do I feel this way' and just experience my emotions without any judgement or thinking that there's something wrong with me. Bipolar can be a gift, to experience life in ways others cannot.

&amp;#x200B;

I think being told that bipolar is a bad thing and it's an illness did me so much more harm than if had been told that i'm ok the way I am, I just need to learn how to experience it whilst keeping myself safe.";1384;61;244;24;25;443;174;324

I look at death and illness so I can try to feel something for someone. Every thing is pointless now. I want my purpose back. ;506;23;105;8;15;170;79;132

I haven't been to school since before Christmas and right now my goals are to take a shower every week and get through the day. I was gone for some time last semester as well and will probably not get a grade in a few classes. This week I met with my school counselor, main teacher and my ""psychologist"" about school. I'm currently being evaluated for bipolar but it seems pretty clear that I'm going to be put on some medication at least, which is kind of terrifying. Though it will be some time until then. 

So, my options are to either take the rest of the school year off and start this autumn redoing my school year, or take 3 classes now and the rest next year. Everyone excepts me to have an answer, but I don't. I can't even answer simple questions like ""What do you want to eat?"". I wish somebody would just tell me even though I know I have to decide myself. I just can't seem to care. I could barely speak and focus throughout the meeting and my mom ended up speaking mostly. The psychologist brought up shortly how I was last time we talked and I felt shameful for how I had acted. I talked with my brother about how things have been lately and he could kind of relate to my ""ups"", only it's from his experiences with drugs. I didn't think it was that bad and it seems he thought he was experiencing a milder version of what I was experiencing. That hit me.

Idk if school thrown into the mix will help, and now my whole class knows I struggle mentally (in Norway we have a main class that take certain subjects together). I've also been oversharing with some people and I feel like everyone is looking at me differently. I feel like a disease and a pushover. I'm making everything worse and being distant to everyone but I can't help it. Mom deserves better than me. Though it would maybe be better to take 3 classes now instead of everything next year. The thing is that I haven't been able to concentrate at all. Up or down. When I was up there was just too much noise in my head and I had too many other plans. I couldn't even concentrate on what I wanted to do and kept jumping between a lot of things. Still I was 100% sure I could catch up to everything in a couple days which didn't happen. I ended up not sleeping making a workout schedule that was ridiculous, especially for someone who doesn't excercise, drinking a lot of Bailey's to calm down (didn't work) even though I rarely drink, then jogging and working out.

nine months on, i'm beginning to wonder if i'm ever getting diagnosed. i tried to bring it up to her recently, she said it's still too soon to tell and she wants to get a sense of the timescale of my mood swings by seeing me for longer. i've had a lot of really bad personal life dramas in the last six months, so it's hard for her to see whether my moods are a symptom of mental illness, or just a really normal reaction to the terrible things that have happened to me. she said i clearly have some issues with emotional regulation, but that it doesn't seem like classic bipolar. my GP also mentioned cyclothymia in the past but my psych didn't bring it up at all. i told her that i'm worried about getting a bpd diagnosis because of the stigma, and she understood, but i think that's still in the mix in terms of which things she's considering. in every other sense she's been so lovely and helpful, getting me on the right meds (lamotrigine, which has been a godsend), referring me for counselling, and referring me for a care coordinator so i can get some extra help in between our appointments. so i know she's not a quack, and i trust her completely. it's just hard to understand when i know other people who've gotten diagnosed in their first appointment.

I'm stuck and scared guys. You know that first question they always ask you, *any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?* well I always answer no with the addendum of ""thoughts, however I would never want my family to find me like that or deal with the pain."" 

But recently the thoughts are getting worse, my mind won't stop racing, heart pounding, I'm crying one minute then angry, I'm getting little to no sleep, my paranoia of being watched by my neighbor and others is getting worse (ya, stupid I know can't help it).

He did not address my anxiety, I brought up my meds not working three goddamn times and finally he said let's wait another month and see if it gets better. I can't wait another month, I'm in pain so bad mentally and physically. I'm tired of this, I cut my hair super short again so I would stop pulling it now but now my skin picking has doubled and that gives me anxiety about getting help because I'm worried they will think I'm on drugs cause the picking. 

I went to a inpatient facility in July last year and it didn't help at all I have been so scared of them doing nothing while I sit in a strange place for another ten days not getting better. Last time the psych doc took me off my anxiety meds as soon as I got checked in because he didn't like them and despite many freak out the clinic left me to cry hidden in the corner of my room for hours multiple days.

 Psych doc kept trying to put me back on seroquel even though I told him it makes me freak out he wanted me to try it anyways I did it did nothing but make me panic cry and my heart felt like it would burst (my BPM was 168 thought I was dying). I want to go hide for the rest of my life I want this misery to end. But I'm kinda stuck right now and it's making me panic more out of indecision.

Therapy is an interesting thing for me.  Because I come from a very traumatic background, therapy has been a godsend for PTSD-related issues.

Knowing I'll have someone to help me sort through random thoughts and make sense of any major shifts or psychotic issues allows me to keep the jumble in the background.  It's like static; I can tolerate the static when I know there will eventually be someone who can help me understand how the radio works. (bad example but best I can do.)

We were all of the understanding that, yes, in fact, I get a great deal of benefit from therapy.  Now I'm one month into not having therapy, and things are falling absolutely apart.

737;bipolarreddit;jibberjabbery;01/01/2018;"2017 was brutal All of my recent med changes were on 2017. Zoloft made me mixed and totally insane, I got lithium poisoning, akathisia from abilify, suicidal from trileptal, suicidal on latuda, depakote didn't work out, haldol wasn't right, too much wellbutrin made me unstable. It's been an almost nonstop joyride.

I almost hospitalized myself a few times. I've never been before so it's a big deal. I legitimately almost killed myself on 3 occasions. I dabbled in self harm. I had a very rough year. Professionally I didn't get along with my old teaching team and they turned our kids against me. Principal got involved and was on my side, it was ugly. So I finished my first year of teaching and now my second year is going much better but the end of that first year was miserable.

2017 was not my friend.

I saw an idea on Facebook to put a note in a jar each week that has one good thing that happened that week on each note then at the end of the year look at all of the great things that happened. I love that idea.

Here's to hoping everyone has a better 2018. It can't be worse than 2017, that's for sure.";879;30;174;13;22;280;129;218

I Googled around to learn more, and I came across a bullshit shaming listicle from BP Hope (I thought they were our friends!!!) basically saying “just discipline yourself!”. As if everybody gets the impulse to stay up into the wee hours organizing their bathroom, or the compulsion to spend their whole paycheck on something they didn’t give a shit about a week ago, or the brilliant idea to start their own business with no money, but they’re just better at controlling it. 

At work, it seems to take me twice the time to do things as everyone else, and it’s largely due to constant small, but uncontrollable things I “have to do”.

So, i notice when its that time of the month or whatever (i've pretty much always noticed this), My moods get a bit dangerous. i'll be mostly stable the rest of the month but since i'm already a sensitive person when i'm on my period, i feel like my moods go to the extremes, really quick. right now, i keep having random extremely angry thoughts. i don't have anything to be mad about. but i just feel almost uncontrollably angry. its like literally my brain goes to polar opposites and its frustrating. I've been dealing with extreme moods while on my period for a really long time. i'm just not sure if its me or if Bipolar has an effect? Does anyone know if BP amps up the mood swings or am i just a moody bitch? lol. 

I currently am not on any medication due to some insurance problems. but i do smoke weed regularly (indica only) and it helps a LOT. more than the pills in my opinion, but i know i need meds, just need to figure out this whole insurance thing.

In the past i've been on MANY medications &amp; honestly, none of them helped while it was that time of the month. Some of them made me worse (more depressed/triggered Mania). I've been told Birth Control helps, but i don't notice a difference.

I've never had acne problems before, even in high school. i would get maybe *one* zit every once in awhile. So, having this acne suddenly for no reason was affecting my self confidence a lot. Not only that, Lithium was also severely affecting my short term memory,  so after much deliberation, My pdoc has decided to ween me off.

Here's where it gets scary to me. I haven't had a med change since February of 2017, besides a few Lithium tweaks here and there. I've been pretty stable for months and my blood tests have been alright.  But...I'm terrified of going back on the roller coaster. 

This med change was somewhat needed. I have been hallucinating *a lot*. i hear voices, see things that aren't there, etc. I've also been so paranoid to the point i dont leave my house much other than work and back.

894;bipolarreddit;lost_frisson;04/01/2019;"How much value do you place on having sex? I've been realizing that my hyper sexuality has affected how much value I put on having sex. When I was growing up I used to put so much priority on having sex. It would constantly be on my mind and I would feel like I was missing out on such a massive part of existence if I wasn't able to regularly have it. Haha, that sounds so dramatic.

The older I get though the more I realize that the importance I was putting on sex is mostly based on the emotions created by the mania/hyper sexuality. When I step back for a moment and stop listening to my emotions and look at it logically I don't really care as much about it. I put more value on non-sexual intimacy like snuggling/holding hands/sleeping together, and the most value on having a verbal connection with someone where we can comfortably share our deepest fears and darkest secrets.

Its confusing because my feelings and even my thoughts can be so drastically influenced/manipulated by the chemical reactions going on in my brain/body. So there are times where sex seems like the ultimate high. Then other times where I choose to not base my actions on achieving highs and chasing feelings and instead I do things that align with the values I have built over years based on logic and philosophy.

How do you value sex, do you base a lot of your actions/decisions around it? Or maybe it just seems like a bonus to being alive but doesn't matter much? Do your feelings on it drastically change based on your mental state?";1219;51;213;30;19;407;158;288

I applied for this radio station job last week with the expectation that I would work part-time doing the news and some office work. It's not my ideal dream scenario but it's a job in radio, which I love more than anything else.

I walked into the interview today and knocked it out of the park. So much so that the owner is going a completely different direction with me. He offered me a morning drive show simulcast on two of their stations. They've never done a live, local show on this radio station. Like...ever.

I wrote this in my initial post, but getting into radio was part of my therapy and mental well-being. The idea was that if I did something I loved that mentally/creatively stimulated me then I would be prone to having fewer episodes and just be in a better place overall.

This proved to mostly work. I was able to be creative to a point but I was still restricted by someone else's parameters. This new job would offer me the chance to build something from the ground up. It's giving me the opportunity to build my own brand. I've always looked at radio as a form of art and I've just been given a blank canvas. 

My wife didn't know how to handle me when I came home today. She hasn't seen me like this in over a year. My moods haven't really cycled; they've pretty much been low and lower. I feel higher than I've felt in a really long time. She couldn't stop smiling and hugging me.

The documentary is a brutally honest look at his life and struggles with bipolar disorder.

I also work in broadcasting (radio) and the documentary hit me pretty hard. Hearing him talk about everything and seeing the things he’s gone through (and still goes through) was a little weird for me because I kept saying over and over, “That’s me. I do that. That happens to me, too.” It was a relief in a way because it was a reminder that I’m not the only one, but it was also uncomfortable to watch at times because I felt like I was watching myself. I can’t tell if I feel better or worse after seeing it.

I came out of the appointment very upset because the doctor didn't seem to want to help me, didn't seem to get what I was saying, wanted me to stop taking the meds that had pulled me out of a year-long suicidal depression. I hadn't slept more than an hour the night before, so the appointment is a bit of a blur, but I felt betrayed by the system and cried for hours.

I saw the pdoc for a second time today and my impression of her was completely different. Apparently she is not a psycho monster bitch. She clearly wants to help me and has a reasonable approach, even if it's not what I would have chosen.

I also realized that I have gaps in my memory from that time - like I know one of my friends was concerned enough about my state of mind to call my mother - but, for example, I completely don't remember one of my friends coming over and visiting me for several hours. Granted, I was drinking a lot over that period, but not enough to completely forget events. It makes me wonder what else I'm not remembering.

I'm diagnosed BPII but I know that over about 6 weeks I spent way too much money, hardly slept (or sometimes even didn't) for days at a time, and drove so recklessly that I could have been arrested if I had been caught. I just didn't go to work a few times. Also had a few panic attacks. I had some pretty big ideas but I wasn't psychotic, so manic vs. hypomanic? Don't really know, don't really care too much, but I normally consider myself a very grounded and rational person so feeling like I can't trust my memory freaks me the fuck out.

I guess this is more of a vent than anything. It's the first hypomanic episode I've had that can compete with (milder) depressive episodes in terms of negative impact on my life. I don't really know how to come to terms with the fact that I can't trust my memory from that time.

And I know how it looks. I KNOW. It looks like I want a legitimate way to slack off, but that isn’t what happens. I did my best to not abuse those previous accommodations because they were my saving grace at the end of the semester. I’m not completely incompetent. I can follow the syllabus, text classmates, and do my best to keep up with the class materials. But sometimes I just cannot leave my bed.

So much has gone wrong this past month. Life has just taken a huge shit on me at the beginning of this semester and I need help. I have an established relationship with a psychiatrist in this new town, but I need a therapist. She gave me a list and I’ve been playing phone tag with her top recommendation and I just *can’t* anymore. I don’t have the energy. I’m here by myself, away from family, freaked out by my creepy neighbors, and just struggling in general. 

The only two things I can focus on are my schoolwork and taking care of my dog. And everyday I feel like I’m failing at even that. My house is a mess. I’m a mess. My eating habits are horrible. I feel the temptation of hard alcohol everyday... so I binge eat then starve then binge. Luckily my alcohol consumption hasn’t gotten out of control, tho I am planning on cutting it out completely again. 

I thought discussion questions were due at midnight on Sunday’s, but they’re due at 8 pm. I had confused between two different class’s deadlines. My prof has been so understanding but god I need to show I’m not trying take advantage of any slack she has given me. She’s been so great at balancing having compassion but not coddling me. I really like her. 

And I’m just asking for this one thing from my school. Their department is a fucking mess. My psychiatrist had dealt with them before and said she needs to be contacted by them first before writing any sort of letters detailing why I need this accommodation. I told this to the DR but they insisted that wasn’t the case. So I call my psychiatrist and she insisted that that’s how it’s always been and won’t write anything until she’s contacted by them. Then my assigned counselor sent me a passive aggressive email that the recommendation I had sent in did not explain why I needed an ESA. Shit lady, I was not asking for a fucking emotional support animal! Get your fucking shit together. 

Family connections can be great tho, my mother works at the university and knows the chair or director or what fucking ever of the DR and insists that I call him and go over the counselor’s head. But god I just do not have the energy. 

I don’t have the energy for any of this. Sometimes I wish I was still a minor so my mom could just make my appts for me. For the first time in years I just want my mom to take care of me like she used to. I don’t want to be responsible for dealing with this shit. 

I’m being kept awake by my racing heart rate being brought on by my anxiety. I’m all out of clonazepam until at least Wednesday. I had two beers left over and self medicated just to calm down a little, but when I lay my head down all I can hear is my racing heart. 

I need help. I know how to ask for it. Where to find it. But god I just don’t have the energy... The short days are even harder to deal with here due to the fucking freezing temperatures. Everything is so much harder when it’s this cold. 

I’m just in this stupid self pity party where I’m just asking “why me????” 

I’m really sorry for the length. I just don’t have anywhere to turn right now. ";3386;120;673;73;76;1117;334;846
1073;bipolarreddit;Odramabama;28/01/2019;"Anyone ever done a liver cleanse? It honestly sounds like bullshit but I’ve hit a wall recently so I’m willing to expand my options a little. 

I was telling my pdoc about how I’m struggling recovering from the holidays. When I was out of town with my family for about a week, I had one beer the entire time. My four hour drive home ended up being six hours due to three separate accidents. It was taking me multiple days to recuperate, it felt like I had been on a drinking binge. When I told her all this, she said sometimes stress and changes in the environment can affect the way your liver functions just as much as it can affect your brain. The stress of family then being hit with an especially stressful trip from sea level to 7,000 ft could have really messed things up. 

So I’m giving this a try. She ordered some “liver sauce” for me. It’s this gnarly tasting oil I take as soon as I wake up then thirty mins later I have to take a charcoal binder. 

If it were some random person telling me to ditch my meds and do a liver cleanse instead, I’d tell them to fuck off. But I’ve been with this pdoc for almost a decade now so I’m trusting her judgement. I’m still on all my meds and she told me to try and be more mindful about what I’m putting in my body. So I’m trying to avoid the temptation of fast food even tho I don’t feel like I have the energy to make healthy meals. 

I’ve only been on it for a week so I’m not expecting immediate results. 

Has anyone else tried out “alternative” methods like this? Specifically stuff that has been recommended by a doctor? ";1240;40;254;20;27;408;177;317
1132;bipolarreddit;PestoPastaPenne18;01/04/2018;"Question I’ve been very conflicted the last several days. I started Vraylar 5 days ago and have noticed since that I’ve been feeling small charges of minor, anxious energy and even more minor things happening during my sleep. Today I went further and got my usual Hypomania symptoms: warmth/pressure in chest, random thoughts, forgetting thoughts, many ideas but it was still more minor than my last episode and lasted shortly (under an hour). 
My last episode btw, also seemed to include rapid cycling and maybe mixed states. I would cycle between HM, normal, or depression in one day or under a day and have symptoms of all 3 during HM. The previous episode which was my first a year ago, wasn’t like this. Sure I had the energy spikes here and there but it wasn’t nearly as intense in symptoms and I didn’t cycle between depression, just crashed into it at the end. (And boooyy that was my worst depressive episode yet).

Anyhow after this recent episode, I crashed into bad depression with suicidal thoughts then went baseline and have been that way till the last few days. My question is- is the Vraylar causing hypomania or have I progressed into rapid cycling due to my illness being untreated for a year and the meds are helping it, which is why it’s so minor? I know this is a lot but damn, this is confusing and worrisome ";1065;51;178;17;19;329;138;244

1139;bipolarreddit;pigeonsplease;28/03/2018;"My job has become too much. What do I do next? I work at a coffee house/bar. I've been in there for almost five years. I've even been told I'm a crucial part of the team and promoted to assistant manager. 

I like certain parts of my job: restocking, getting everything in order before the end of my shift, making drinks (coffee &amp; booze), flexible hours (I work 3-4 days a week).

For the longest time I also loved the company culture. They seemed to really care. And I love most of my coworkers, and they've become close friends. But lately it seems like the company doesn't care at all, and besides making me feel undervalued, my day to day experience is also incredibly stressful. Management has made this job pretty toxic, and I've been super depressed for months (maybe I would've been otherwise, but the focus of most of my depressive thoughts has been my shitty work environment).

I'm feeling really ready to leave this job, but I'm also terrified about what to do next.

I don't really like dealing with people all day. I've gotten by this long at my job without losing my shit mostly by being the utility player and spending more effort keeping things running smoothly while other coworkers do more of the small talk that I find so emotionally taxing. But, if I can avoid it, I'd rather not go into another customer service job.

I've considered so many different careers, and I've gotten pretty enthralled with each idea for a time &amp; then talked myself out of every one. I've seriously considered nursing, social work, teaching, and making toys/theatrical puppets/art directing sort of deal. 

I just don't know what I can do that'll give me the time off I need to function while being fulfilling and not emotionally draining. 

Do you have any advice on selecting jobs/careers? 

I'm just feeling so overwhelmed by the prospect of making these decisions, but I don't feel like I have the luxury to put off these decisions any longer because this job has really gotten to the point of pushing me over the edge.";1609;64;277;37;23;529;201;381

I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 6 years and he’s amazing, but he’s not feeling the same need to suddenly have sex all the time and the sex we have been having feels a bit unfulfilling and like I’m just going through the motions.

I’ve also had what was a harmless crush on a coworker for a while, but lately I feel like it’s getting into risky territory where I’m changing my wardrobe and behavior and it even got to the point where he (jokingly? I can’t tell right now!) asked me out even though he knows my boyfriend well. And I didn’t say yes but the best I could do was say that it’d make my boyfriend sad.

(other a 4 day medication induced hypomania that was quickly resolved by adding a typical antipsychotic) WOOT.
 
* **Better News**: I was offered a position that will be part of a 3 year national research project that will be working with the same population I am already working with - people with severe and persistent mental illness. Once I announced that I'd be leaving my current organization I found out that despite me not feeling like I fit in with my team due to our extremely different backgrounds and ages that they really DO value me as a team member and the contributions I have made to our program! I thought that this coupled with more daylight hours was contributing to my decrease in depressive symptoms. 

* **Shitty News**: I am starting to notice yellow and red flags of swinging into hypomania; despite not taking my stimulant medication, and abstaining from caffeine I have had three hours of sleep in the past 3 days and am not tired. Tense body and jaw clenching, speaking at a faster pace than my baseline and being way more chatty than normal and last but not least; impulsive shopping for big ticket items that last one is more of a red flag.
 
* **Less Shitty News**: I had the cash to do it without spending bill money or putting it on my credit card and I still have enough in my accounts necessities until next payday
 
* **Good Idea**: Talking to my therapist about this tomorrow at my appointment and following up with my psychiatrist about this and trialing a new antipsychotic while starting a new job. Out of the 4 I have been on, only one did not turn me into a zombie. But I did develop temporary tardive dyskinesia after being on it for a few months so it was discontinued and the TD went away.

* ***Horrible Idea***: Not bringing this up so I can ride the wave at my last week at my current organization, and for the first few weeks at my new job.

*Quess which idea seems more appealing right now, as I am awake at 4am and I have an all clinic staff meeting at 8 with an hour and a half commute - in good weather.* I know what I ***should*** do but, goddamn, I just want a lil taste of it. 

Edit: I do have some what of a crisis plan set up with my mom so that I don't spend ALL of my money or rack up credit card debt, wherein I get an agreed upon amount of cash for the week out of my checking account and she holds on to all of my cards so I cannot absolutely fuck myself and kiddo finacially.

1150;bipolarreddit;PlaidCoat;10/01/2019;"Reasonable Accommodation Frustration. To start off with I have a few different mental health disabilities. I am fortune that I am employed full time! I am also ""out"" about having a severe and persistent mental illness at work.

However being in my office causes me some issues in being easily distracted by things going on around me. My disability causes some executive function deficits, along with hyper arosal (awareness... Not the sexy kind) 

This summer my 5 year old was diagnosed with two chronic, incurable autoimmune diseases. This of course has made mental health stuff worse. I was lucky to be in a DBT program when it happened or I'd be in a horrible spiral right now. I knew it would effect my performance and I asked my direct supervisor, and manager about working from home 8 to 16 hours a week as an accommodation. At previous jobs this has been heart for keeping me up to date in notes. I was told that as an orginzation we do not have a policy for this.


I said fuck it, and worked from home anyways (making sure I didn't go over my hours) and got caught up. Woo! 

Over the fall we had a lot of staffing changes and I wound up with double the work load for 3 months. I have stopped working from home becuse I was worried in would get caught and get sacked. My performance has suffered and my new supervisor has noticed.

I again went to my supervisor and director and was told the same thing about their being no policy allowing us to work from home. So I went to HR, with documentation from my care provider. HR just now got back to me, after a month. Again they implied they where (but didn't out right) denying the request. 

I've been in contact with an ADA specialist in my state, along with AskJAN about this and it's super frustrating. 

The best/worst and most ironic part of all of this? Our orginzation serves people with disabilities. This is what we do for them and teach them what to do. How to obtain and maintain emoloyment. My caseload is only people, like me, who have a serious or sevre and persistent mental illness. Ain't that some shit? I love the people I serve, and what I do and this is really leaving a sour taste in my mouth about the orgization. 

If you read this whole thing... THANK YOU for listening. I am so frustrated with the situation and I'm not gonna give up this fight.

I was an angry kid. Just... I was BAD. There was so obviously a problem, but not one they could really do anything about. You can't really help a kid whose primary problem is ""thinks everyone wants to hurt him"". Doctors tried to fit me into these neat little diagnostic labels, even though nothing ever really fit. They tried to give me all these medications, even though nothing ever really worked. And when I only got worse, this only confirmed my original hypothesis.

I'm still angry. At a society that doesn't believe victims of child abuse, sexual assault, violence... ANYTHING. I'm angry that I was given such a rough hand. Some might call this a ""sense of entitlement"", whatever that means (""Other people have it worse!"" said the better-off person.) But... fuck. I'm not demanding anything other than wanting to stay alive.

I know what I need to do. I need to find a psychiatrist. A therapist. Probably a medication change. I've just been dealing with so much shit in my life that I've completely neglected my mental health. I've pretty much destroyed myself just trying to survive. Because I've been doing it all on my own and it's just... too much right now.

A few years ago, I heard someone describe anger as a motivating force. I never understood this. To me, anger has only been a force of destruction... not unlike fire. If my anger is a small spark, my brain's reaction to feeling it is the equivalent of dousing it with gasoline.

Yet kept in a small confined area, with a watchful eye, a fire can keep you warm. It can be a light in the dark. It serves a purpose. Fuck, sometimes it's just beautiful. And if I have a choice, I'm not going to freeze to death or live my life in the dark.

1218;bipolarreddit;red_sky_at_morning;12/02/2018;"I took a shower and it was glorious Since the beginning of December I've been struggling with a couple of manic episodes. As the month went on I noticed a spike in my anxiety, but it was around the holidays and I was able to get a handle on it for the most part with my Xanax prescription. After a negative experience with my father during the holidays, my anxiety only increased until by January I couldn't get a handle on it. It developed in to full blown paranoia. I was (and still somewhat am) convinced I was being watched, especially from the strip of woods behind my house. Every time my German Shepherd would let out a guard dog bark at the back door I would lose my shit. If I needed to go to the grocery store I would go either very early in the morning or very late at night when there would be virtually no one there. If I turned to go down and aisle and saw another person there, I was overcome with a sense of uncomfortable dread and would wait in hiding until I saw them leave the aisle and go elsewhere. 

This lasted me all of January and I shamefully only showered maybe two or three times from the beginning of December to the end of January. I kept my hair tied up and didn't brush it unless I was going to shower. My first shower since maybe all of January or at least the middle of it, and when I went to take my hair tie out it just kept getting more tangled. I had to have my fiancé cut it out of my hair, and when I tried to unwrap the bun it wasn't unwinding. I asked him to look at it and he was shocked and told me my hair was completely knotted together. Luckily he was able to untangle it without having to take scissors to it. And let me tell you, even with a detangler brush the layer of knots on top and underneath my hair were RUTHLESS. My hand cramped up during it and my eyes may have teared up a couple times but I got through it. Unfortunately, for the past week and a half I did not shower and did not brush my hair. Same results as far as my fiancé having to cut out another hair tie and unknot my hair, but that shower was HEAVENLY! I got the shampoo super lathery and just scrubbed every inch of my scalp. Then I let a deep conditioner sit while I washed my body and was able to do a second wash after I rinsed the conditioner and used my medicated body wash for my body acne (chest, back, and even upper arms!) I put all my products in my hair- about 8 totally I believe- and exfoliated my face and neck and put on a super moisturizing mask before doing my normal skincare routine. 

I'm going through a manic episode now, and was up all night but I was able to take a shower and get ready early enough to actually be on time for once since my best friend/Maid of Honor was coming over so we could go to my mom's and get my Save the Dates addressed and ready to finally send out, seeing as they were supposed to be done end of December/early January. I also did 4 hours worth of much needed cleaning and decluttering. I feel very accomplished and refreshed but at the same time a little invalidated because most of this most likely wouldn't have gotten done if I wasn't manic. Still, my hair is soft, my skin is glowing, and my Save the Dates are finally done! Hopefully after my appointment with my psychiatrist on Tuesday, I can get on the road to getting my moods and emotions to a manageable level.

I also find it kinda hard to carry on a conversation with someone I dont know, and making eye contact is a bitch for me (makes me insecure and nervous but no disorders like down syndrome or ADD), Just in general I'm not coping with life that well, my last post I was coming off  Lamotrigine which didnt seem to hell either. I also found my habit of smoking pot coming back rather strong actually, as of now I know I'm addicted to marijuana (sounds retarded I know)

Anyway I'm taking 100mgs and still getting angry quite a bit, I feel kinda numb sometimes like i cannot get angry or really think, when I get angry I yell, throw shit, smash shit, think about suicide, and by the end of my fit I usually have bloody knuckles and borderline pulp of knuckles. What usually calms me down is just punching shit super hard til I realizemy body is in pain, or if my dog has the balls to come up too me and chill me out (I dont physically harm anyone or anything).

Pretty much just wondering if their is other medication or if I need to up my dose or anything of the soft and advice would be amazing, thanks  ;812;25;137;13;12;269;125;193
1272;bipolarreddit;rustygrape;23/01/2018;"Death of Seasons [self-hatred] (/spoiler) I was listening to one of my favorite songs from grade school, and I realized that it fits perfectly in describing how I feel towards depression, my will to survive depression, and the angst, remorse, and grief of falling into a depression. Here is the song:  
.  
.  
.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
""Of late, it's harder just to go outside  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
  To leave this deadspace with hatred, so alive  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
  Writhing with sickness, thrown into banality, I decay  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
  Killed by the weakness, but forced to return, turn it off    
  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I watch the stars as they fall from the sky  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I held a fallen star and it wept for me, dying  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I feel the fallen stars encircle me, now as they cry  
  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Out there so quickly grows malignant tribes  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Posthuman extinction excels unrecognized  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Feeling surrounded, so bored with mortality, I decay  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
All of this hatred is fucking real, turn it on... yeah  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
It won't be all right despite what they say  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Just watch the stars tonight as they, as they disappear, disintegrate  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
And I disintegrate 'cause this hate is fucking real  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
And I hope to shade the world as stars go out and I disintegrate""  


The first stanza starts the process of slipping into depression. It’s hard to leave the walls that are now built around you, the hatred drawn inwards is real and deadly. Leaving is an escape, but the mind of depression “forces” you to return inwards, retreat back home, and continue the stages of decay, even violence:  “Killed by the weakness…turn it off""

The second stanza is how I see this process of suffering being reflected in the natural world through the observation of stars. I am reminded of the title of the song “Death of Seasons” which is organic and relates to nature. There is compassion inherent in seeing the suffering of them: “I held a fallen star and it wept for me” / “The fallen stars encircle me” is an act of compassion by nature itself, reminding me that the feelings of depression and disconnection are universal.

The third stanza is also about the outside world, but a reflection on society and other people, which is viewed as working a brutal and threatening agenda (malignant tribes). For me, viewing the world at large in this way begins to give birth to thoughts that lead me to believe that the world is cruel, and that I no longer wish to participate in it, which completes the process of depression and fatefully, gives rise to the momentum of wanting to take my own life.

The bridge, or last stanza, is a confirmation of the reality of depression, merely the way things are, so to speak. The vocalist directs the attention to the sky, and sees the completion of the cycle, the end of the season when things wither and die. Yet compassion for the whole world is alive, “I hope to shade the world as stars go out” which still amazes me, that in the throes and thick of a hard depression the parts of me that want to help and be a part of the world live on.";2833;108;391;68;21;852;235;537
1272;bipolarreddit;rustygrape;05/02/2019;"Should I get my own apartment? (currently living with parents) Hi guys,

I am currently apartment hunting with the approval of my step-father who has agreed to help pay for an apartment of my own while I wait for disability benefits. I think it would be very helpful and therapeutic for me if I created my own space that I deemed to be sacred and worth my time. One of the fears that I have is that I would feel alone in this apartment, and fall into depression and anxiety. Maybe my meds will help with that. Also I have anxiety about needing to go out and get groceries on a weekly basis. But maybe this would be good for me and I would be able to hit up the natural food stores. I also would choose not to bring my cat with me (who is very therapeutic and supportive) because she is happy here at this home. But I won't have her around. Maybe I could get a small fish aquarium. Also I would have space for some small fitness equipment, like a kettle bell and barbell. Well I hope that if I do get an apartment it will be a good decision. I just don't want to be alone and depressed. But I am sure that is normal for many of us who live alone. We just have to make sure we have a solid routine of having activities to do outside the house and around people. ";987;33;204;15;17;319;128;252

1303;bipolarreddit;scurius;13/01/2018;"Insights from over two years of custom mood tracking (SO MUCH DATA) **Some background statistics are needed to understand these interpretations, and I'll do the most basic explanation I can to make it most accessible (while risking misrepresenting it; if you want to get pedantic and explain it better in the comments, go ahead). The explanations are in the footnotes below.**

* my mood over the past two years has improved slightly but overall stayed about the same. an average mood of 64.76 for 2016 and 64.91 for 2017, that's something.

* 576 days out of 741 (~77%) of days felt more good than bad.

* I spent 92 days in the last two years with a mood lower than 40% (~12% of the 741 days)

* I spent 15 days severely depressed (~2%)

* I spent 8 days with strong suicidal feelings and 3 days actively pursuing suicide

* I spent 159 days with a mood above 80%. 57 were in 2017, 99  were in 2016, and the remainder were in either 2015 or 2018, for which few days have been recorded.

* I spent 24 days euphoric (mood 90+%)

* I spent 8 days on top of the world euphoric (mood&gt;92%)

* my mood had a standard deviation of 18.86 percentage points for 2016 and 15.60 percentage points for 2017, I've gotten more stable. A full time job does that I guess. So does no longer having the tribulations of terminal cancer in your life.

* my happiest days of the last two years were all in 2016 (lower standard deviation suggested as much) (an emphatic thank you to the redditor behind 8/14/16 being one of them)

* my custom manic rating scale suggests I spent 34 days in 2017 some kind of manic (~9.3%) and 51 days in 2016 some kind of manic (~14%)

* Getting off lowers my stress levels and increases my mood: each orgasm reduces my perceived stress by 3 percentage points. with a p value of under .001. With mean stress levels of 35.7%, that's about an 8.4% difference per orgasm. Each orgasm also raises my mood by about 3 percentage points, for a typical increase of ~4.7% per orgasm.

* each 1 (out of 10) point increase in my stress levels increases my anxiety on average by 4 percentage points. With mean anxiety levels of 28% that's a 14% difference per point.

* the effects of alcohol on my mood are unclear. My mood tracker strongly suggests (P&lt;.001) I drink more when I feel good, but the direction of causality here is likely such that I drink because I feel good rather than because it makes me feel good. The data isn't of a nature that can tell me how it affects me during the duration of alcohol. It's clear there isn't sufficient evidence to strongly support the hypothesis that alcohol makes me in particular depressed.

* sleep plays a highly significant role in minimizing stress and anxiety, with p values of .01 and .03 respectively and meaningful correlation coefficients.

* weed improves my mood by .624 percentage points per level of r/trees high-ness scale. with a p value of .019 and a mean mood of 64.84, that's about a 1% improvement per point of highness. At a total high, that's a 10% increase in mood (and a very high likelihood of experiencing some psychosis). At a moderate high, that might be a 5% increase in mood. In other words weed definitely improves my mood overall, but at level other factors are still very important. ***It's worth noting that the percentage increase in mood is different based on the baseline mood, if I'm at a suicidal depression (typical such mood around 15% (1 is most suicidal ever on my scale)), a 10 point increase in mood is actually an increase in mood of ~67%)***. I actually used weed the last time I was suicidal to get out of those feelings and it helped me. Weed is risky and makes some of us psychotic and can make us depressed. Use it with caution if at all.

* weed increases my sleep. with an average night's sleep lasting 7.96 hours and an increase of .045 hours per point of the r/trees high-ness scale, for a very strong high increasing my hours slept by a half hour (this is probably weaker than it should be because of an alarm)

* weed impairs my cognition. p value &lt;.002

* weed causes me psychosis with a p value of less than .001. Typically the psychosis hasn't been severe, so it's something I've continued. It's not helping me, but that's why they call it a vice.

* I drank a bit more in 2017 than 2016 thanks to a bender around July where I learned to cope with boredom better (1.24 drinks per day vs 1.1 drinks per day), but I've had two drinks in 2018 for an average of .18 drinks per day. I intend to drink again, but I'm giving my liver a break for the time being.

----------

**Things this teaches**

* the effects of substance use are complicated and hard to measure. I deliberately minimized my analysis of alcohol because so few of my tests demonstrated statistical significance. From anecdotal observation I can tell you I've learned it increases the effects of stress on my body and can exacerbate either depression or mania, but that it helps me feel connected to friends. You may benefit in one way but be hurt in another. It's a lot to keep track of, and probably more than my mood tracker can keep track of (and it has 17 columns with 11 variables!)

* sleep and meds make a world of difference

* mood trackers are only as informative as your data, so if you want to see how substances affect you, you've gotta track it measurably.

* a support network and friends can make a world of difference (learned through observation and verified with it, but still)

* meds definitely help


----------------

**Pretty dumbed down statistics**

P value is most basically explained as the likelihood of occurring due to chance with 1 meaning 100% and 0 meaning couldn't randomly occur at all (I know this isn't quite right, but this is a simplification). R squared is how well an algorithm explains the data. a high r squared means a regression has high explanatory power. 1 is a perfect fit, 0 is no fit. Beta is the strength of a correlation. If my mood is measured on a 100 point scale and one unit of sleep changes my mood by +6 points, then sleep would have a beta of 6. Standard deviation is a descriptor for the amount of variation in a data set. If everything is close to average, it's got a low standard deviation. If everything is very disparate, it will have a high SD.

Edit 2: I wanted to share it but was feeling too worn out to set up a new one for you guys, but u/glitter-beast reminded me [I posted about it before and had a dropbox saved file for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/6mmchn/making_a_mood_tracker_how_i_did_it_why_you_might/). I updated the one I linked in the description there to make it more likely to output possible mania (as it seemed to fail at this), corrected an error that was getting in the way of accurate alcohol-related depression results, and changed the dates to be for 2018

Edit 3: the biggest thing I might change for yourself if I was you would be the role of your sex drive in your manic rating. Most people don't keep the same baseline libido as I do, and plenty of people don't have their libido as a very strong indicator of mania.";5634;242;1003;132;128;1814;491;1320

1327;bipolarreddit;shawnbenteau;22/02/2018;"Lithium and loss of identity I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 just about two years ago now and have been on lithium since. I started at I think 600, then 900 after a few weeks, then 1050 a few months later and finally 1200 after my counts didn't come back after a rough bout of serotonin syndrome a year and a half ago.

The changes were so slow that I didn't notice them until I went back and read posts I had made at the time. I've never really interacted with other bipolar people so I don't have much frame of reference, and I've been worrying lately that I might just be different now and I don't notice it (from either the lithium or the serotonin syndrome). It feels like the kind of thing that's impossible to know. I can't remember who I was six months ago, much less two years.

I've had the intrusive thought of ""stop taking your meds they're bad for you and you don't like swallowing them"" and was hoping to reach out for some commentary one way or the other. I hope this makes sense/sounds familiar to someone at least. ";817;26;167;14;13;263;122;207

We were of the same mind. Good in theory, but no real science to support their claims. With MDD and PTST sure, but bipolar is a different kind of beast. Anyways I get a call from the doc that runs the cliinic. We talk for about 15 minutes and I get all my questions answered. They claim an 80% success rate. That seem super high for me. Also insurance doesn't cover it so it would all be out of pocket. I am a prime candidate, but I'm not going to pay money to be a lab rat, especially if there's a 20% failure rate.

This has been so helpful to me lately. I'm climbing out of a small depression caused by a medication problem (lithium level got a bit low while tapering off another med). I'm also kind of stressed out by some life stuff outside of my control, it's not terrible more just annoying but I don't like it. I kind of have to realize something always comes up. There are no perfect stretches of time where work isn't stressful, a social situation isn't stressful, etc. But I have a roof over my head, food in my pantry, and love ones around me. **I want to notice that it's okay right now.**

There are three times when a potentially bad thing can hurt you. You can get anxious before it happens (if it happens). You can have it happen. And then you can ruminate and dwell on it. I know I can't always control what happens to me, but I do want to get better at reducing anxiety and rumination. When I think back on events I want to tell myself a story that is neutral, not one that makes it worse. I don't want to invent problems or spin existing problems out of control. It's hard, but these two things are my mental health resolutions for 2019. **I want to appreciate the good moments, and I want to do my best to ensure that bad ones only hurt me once.**

Disclaimer - I'm talking about my own anxiety and rumination over small problems, this isn't meant to dismiss traumatic events that you will naturally feel a lot of anxiety around and ruminate about. Terrible and traumatic things happen. This is more about not spending the entire day worrying about something inconsequential. ";1440;59;268;30;36;474;177;350

Depakote has made a huge difference for me but one reason I was taking a lower than average dose is because a full dose (2,000 mgs I think?) knocked me off my feet, I couldn't get out of bed, I was disoriented, I spent 2 weeks in a haze before the doctor cut my dose in half and then I was fine.

I have an eating problem and I binge eat a lot and I keep the food wrappers in my room because I am embarrassed and don’t want my parents to find out about the binging...

Woke up at 4am and saw a mouse on my bedroom floor and there is always more than one. Must have been attracted by the food wrappers.

I’ll die of embarrassment if they find out, which they will, because all the wrappers are in a bin bag in my room.

1493;bipolarreddit;thesquareunicorn;22/02/2019;"Faking Sorry if I rant but I don't know why people never seem to take me seriously. I've been accused before of exaggerating. And my moods being a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"". Early on, I was diagnosed multiple times with depression and anxiety. Because 75% of my mania is comprised of mixed/dysphoria. I get very moody. The only question anyone ever asked was ""do you spend a lot of money"", and when I was younger I didn't have the money to spend 20,000$ even if I wanted to. Anything else -anger, excessive energy, no sleep, etc- was labelled anxiety or agitated depression. Whenever I disagreed -and rightly so- ""professionals"" thought I was just vying for a bipolar diagnosis. Despite my reactions to the antidepressants they always insisted on. The only way I got properly treated was after a case of road rage.

Years later, I struggle with the fear of being accused of faking. I can see it in their faces. And at times I'm afraid that I'm actually faking. It's been really taking a toll on me lately. 2018 was a year of relapse for me and again with an empty bank account I'm faced with having to ""prove it"". Right now I feel like I should stop taking all of my meds and embrace whatever my brain gives me, maybe I'll be blessed with some euphoric mania. I feel sick. I hate myself. Screw all of them.

It does make me very emotional at times, and I do tend to be super clingy during depressive episodes. Lately I’ve been rapid cycling, which causes me to have more of them. They knew all this, and I was hoping they would understand. But, they told me that they don’t want anything to do with me, and never want to see me or talk to me again. Feels weird. Just this Monday, my therapist told me that my fear of abandonment is just that, a fear, and I need to overcome it. Told me that I need to open new pathways in my brain and know that people won’t leave me. This doesn’t help with that at all.


I started a new job this week, and it’s mind numbingly boring and insanely hard. I’m only on week one and I already hate it. I’m dreading going to work today. But I need this job. It pays well, and I have a decent amount of debt that I need to pay back.

5;bipolarreddit;__sortof;15/03/2019;"Am I disabled? Hi /r/BipolarReddit, long time no see. I've been pretty well, so I haven't been coming around much.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 10 years ago. I wasn't all that compliant with my treatment until about 5 years ago, when I overcame my marijuana addiction and started getting my life under control. I was rediagnosed bipolar I from bipolar II, I revamped all my meds, started in on weekly group therapy then graduated to weekly individual therapy. I'd been working at Starbucks the whole time, but last September I started back in school, and things have been great. I haven't had a major episode in over a year. Sometimes I still get very sad and a little suicidal, and there's some intrusive thoughts here and there with some paranoia/psychotic delusions, but I have a 4.0 GPA!

The thing is though, to pay for my weekly therapy and my medication, I need to maintain 20 hours a week at Starbucks to  be health benefits eligible. I've been juggling school with work since September, and clearly I am capable of doing that. But I'm starting to plan for September, and as part of my program I have to do a placement of 10 hours a week while still maintaining a full time course load, and reddit, I just don't know that this is a good idea. Since September I've been tired all the time, and I have no doubt the psychosis-lite comes on when I am stressed from having 3 papers due in the course of a week while still having to work 20 hours a week while having to go to class while having to go to therapy while having to maintain a social life while having to get exercise while having to cook right so I don't get ill etc etc etc. It seems to me a recipe for relapse. And TBH I'm secretly convinced that I've just been in an extended hypomanic state since September.

I have a couple of friends who've been telling me for years that I should just apply for disability. I am in Ontario, Canada, where I can apply for a bursary for students with permanent disabilities which can pay for services including therapy. Then I could ease off on my hours at Starbucks and still maintain my treatment.

But honestly, I don't feel ""disabled."" I'm working 20 hours a week and maintaining a 4.0 GPA on a full course load. This, it seems to me, is more than fully able people do. I don't think anyone would consider me disabled either, despite my long track record of being in treatment.

I was just hoping to hear some discussion around the word ""disabled,"" its relationship to bipolar disorder, what it means to be given that title by governing agencies, how you feel about the word, the relationship between disability and capability, and whatever else you have to say about the topic!

Also, I just wanted to say while I'm here that this community gave me so much support when I really needed it, and I am glad it's still an awesome community full of amazing people.";2293;100;413;49;28;747;237;547

Im making this post because:

1) I was wondering if any of you have a similar situation where less sleep makes you feel better? And if you have any similar medication history and if you can provide any insight into this situation to me? How did these realizations help you and what were your next steps?

2) If I told my doctor that adderall was making me sleep less, would she take it away from me? I only take it to study, but I fucking love sleeping 6 hours.

I’ve been smoking weed really heavily for a few months, and during my last manic episode it was giving me symptoms of psychosis like hearing voices and eventually started giving me 3 hour long panic attacks where I’m /convinced/ I’m dying. I finally decided to quit weed and threw all my weed out. I bought CBD oil at a hippy grocery store here and decided to try that since it’s literally proven to not make you intoxicated, calm anxiety, and there’s even studies showing it to be an antipsychotic. 

Last night I took it for the first time and I did feel great for the first hour or so. I was estatic that I finally found something that can help me sleep with out making me psychotic. Until I ended up having another panic attack. I became very anxious that every little ache I felt or inch I felt was a sign that I was going to drop dead from cancer anytime soon. I was shaking so hard and would stand up to do something but become so distracted that I’d just walk back and forth a few times and then lay back down in bed. I even heard voices like I usually do when I get really high on strong sativa. I honestly, definitely felt high, and CBD isn’t supposed to make you high at all! It’s just supposed to be like a muscle relaxer. 

I’m honestly so confused about why I had this reaction. I’m not manic anymore, I have definitely crashed into depression and have been depressed for a week or so now. The fact that I’m not manic and *supposedly* wasn’t high when this ‘panic attack’ happened is really concerning to me? Especially because I was still hearing voices? (I say *supposedly* because since there’s not any regulation laws on CBD, technically the manufacturer could leave traces of THC in it and not tell you, so I guess theoretically I could have been high. But I bought really expensive CBD from a really reputable store, so I’m hesitant to think that it would be spiked with THC)

I don’t have any of these symptoms during the day when I’m completely sober. I thought CBD was safe, everyone says it calms you down and relaxes you. Why tf did I have the opposite reaction? What are your experiences with CBD?";1715;68;315;42;33;575;206;415

Recently...well over the past 8 years really, my behavior and moods have deteriorated. It destroyed two jobs and one long term relationship. I had a full psychotic breakdown complete with hallucinations over the weekend. That was my personal breaking point, where I was able to finally admit it could be more than depression. I went to the doctor that day rather than wait til monday like I planned. I am now on anti-psychotics and am waiting to hear back from a specialist, but based on everything he's heard, I most definitely have bipolar.

My lover is no longer my lover. We had been together for many years. She says she still wants to be friends with me, but I do not believe she will be able to do so as I worry she won't ever be able to see past my behaviors while being improperly treated. I did not cheat on her, but I was verbally abusive, absurdly egotistical and prone to addiction and believing positively bonkers things. Now we're trying to move to separate places. I still love her, but I have to let go as I do not think she will ever feel positively towards me due to my actions or the fear that I might relapse while taking this new medication.

My questions are as follows:

* Work and Affording an apartment. How the heck do I do it? I'm working as a moving helper in Canada. That isn't exactly steady work here, but I hadn't been able to concentrate well enough for better previously. Can I apply for disability or some form of assistance while I adjust to the meds and new diagnosis, at least until I'm stable enough to work regularly to earn my rent/bill money?

* Relationships. My family that I had previously abandoned have actually been quite supportive after coming to terms with what I am personally. My wife (common law), is no longer my wife. I do not think she will ever forgive me for the hurt I caused, and I do not believe I may expect her to. How do I move on? Right now I'm trying hard to find answers and to stay busy as I can. I no longer drink (been sober for 5 months now), smoke or game online (gambling on those stupid chance boxes in mobile games, more addictive than you might suspect.). ";1840;72;345;43;31;606;238;444

Long version: 
I've been on Latuda for 3 years, with a 6 week break at the end of a pregnancy (to avoid neonatal withdrawal). Latuda made me feel like shit, but I took it because it's the ""safest"" during pregnancy, according to 2 psychiatrists I talked to. It made me anxious, nauseous, and kind of caused a sundowning effect where I got depressed at night (I called it the ""Night Dreads"").

When I stopped taking it at the end of my pregnancy, I felt so much better, but I know I can't stay off medication. I started taking it again, but the side effects were so nasty that I couldn't deal with them with a newborn. 

My psychiatrist put me on Abilify, but I have to cross titrate. I can't just stop the Latuda. I'm down to 15 mg of Latuda a day, and I'm taking 2.5 mg of Abilify. 

I feel muuuuuch better during the day... more like my old self. However, my Night Dreads have gotten a lot more agitated and started feeling like a mild mixed state. So now I'm wondering which to blame - Latuda, or Abilify? The nausea accompanying it sure feels like Latuda. 

I've been down to 15 mg of Latuda for about a week. I'm debating dropping it completely tomorrow and taking the full 5 mg of Abilify. I'm worried about mania... I have a 5 week old to think about. Can I get some opinions? I'm loathe to give up the Abilify, since I feel so much better during the day now.

38;bipolarreddit;aabd1713;12/04/2018;"Mental deterioration In the past few days, I have been feeling a burgeoning amount of hatred that is warping my beliefs. I am normally a very empathetic and kind person that punishes himself for his constant mistakes and apologizes constantly.

I hurt myself before hurting another person, and I am overly sensitive to criticism. But talking with the person I felt hurt me and reconciling was easy enough. All it took was one conversation and everything would be good.

But that hatred seemed to warp me into a completely different person. I have a very hard time empathizing, and I can't be affected by criticism or even emotions. When my girlfriend or best friend cried, I would feel all their feelings and comfort them genuinely.

But even when my best friend was crying on me, I couldn't feel anything. Even she noted that she said ""It didn't feel normal, it didn't feel like you were really there. I feel like you don't really care about me.""

I have a history of mental illness, my psychiatrist thinks I am bipolar but I suspect otherwise. I am supposed to be on lithium, but I stopped taking it two days ago. These changes happened before lithium, and have been present in the past without lithium so it isn't medication.

That and my willpower feels boosted, I went back to the gym and train much better and more consistently. I shower regularly, do all my work, and meditate before sleeping. I have much better impulse control and I am much calmer. I don't feel fazed by anything, anxiety, fear, sadness, even my usual depression. Other things I have been doing, the one I find slightly disturbing is I made a list of all the people I have ever known.

Each day I write out what they have done to make me hate them, and I conclude that they are worthless to me. So far I have done 10 people, and I no longer feel the slightest bit of attachment. When I write out the thoughts, it feels like someone is telling me these.

When I hesitate he mocks me and laughs about my weakness, and tells me the truth. Although the truth is painful to swallow, it feels like he is my darker self and he is gradually taking control.

He has had his moments throughout my life, where he took complete control and caused havoc without any mind to the consequences. When I was younger he would make me steal money and cause my parents stress.

But as I grew older he grew calmer and more scheming. To the extent where he never consciously manifested and took control, but rather suggested to me what seemed to be rational decisions. But as of late he seems ambitious since I am dealing with very traumatic repressed memories. He appeared smirking in my mirror mocking me, he appeared in my dreams hunting me down. He corned me in every part of my life, slowly breaking me.

Hahaha, I can feel him right now slowly killing me. I wonder how much longer I have left until I am nothing more than a calloused unemotional monster. When my best friend told me I was fake, it deeply disturbed me. What the hell is going on with me?";2389;108;412;45;41;758;268;556

I’ve also been gettin really into meditating and trying to align my chakras (but all the times my mom would tell me to do that before I would sceptically tell her that It is not true) why now? 

I also ordered a 23andme test to see where my ancestors were from cause I want to practice the magic they used to practice? Make no sense but???? 

Like I know this isn’t me and I might be manic but!??? I kinda want to believe I’m just happy and spiritual because I had the most awful depressive episode last month. Then again, I also stopped taking my Lamictal and now I’m titrating back up so yeah I might actually be manic. 

But I’ve been sleeping just fine? I mean, my sleep pattens are a mess but overall I’ve been getting at least 5 hours of sleep every night! Plus it’s not like I’m euphoric all the time? I suddenly get this waves of euphoria and need to dance? At last  happy? 

I also have a atrong desire to go vegan to feel more connected to nature and at the same time to do keto so that I can fast easily and feel more connected to myself! 

I’m making no sense and I know that! But I keep questioning whether I’m actually manic or happy or just faking it 

 I’m honestly confused but happy? ";1334;48;259;26;32;455;169;340
55;bipolarreddit;aimemoimoins;17/02/2019;"I am spiraling. Yesterday my panic attack lasted basically all day and today I've been waking up crying. Like the title says, I feel like I'm losing the battle again. I'm on Lamictal, but this weekend something triggered me and I've been failing to cope. Someone who I thought was my friend invited me to hang out and I had to drive quite a bit so it wasn't like a spur of the moment thing. Then my friend ditched me to hang out with someone else and left me with his friends who I had just met that night. I left in the morning (I was staying over) and they never came back. I did something kind of petty to get back at them and when I called to apologize, they said they ""owed me a call, but were out with their friend X right now"", so that made me feel even more like shit because apparently it's ok to ditch me, but not step out for a phone call. I really cared about this person and it just sucks to be treated like I'm disposable.

58;bipolarreddit;alaskajefferson;03/01/2019;"Vitamin D and B-12 Deficiency Sorry about lack of clarity, I’m not exactly sure how to phrase this because I’m confused myself, and I am on mobile.

I sought out treatment after I was having some pretty concerning suicidal thoughts the past year.

I reached out the a therapist at my University, and immediately was referred to a psychiatrist under the guise of maybe benefitting from mood stabilizers.

Before my psychiatry appointment, I researched into mood stabilizers and saw they were used in treating bipolar. Read up on bipolar and really identified/ understood why she would recommend me to the psychiatrist assuming she thought I could have bipolar. 

Met with the psychiatrist, and not to my surprise she said she was sure I was bipolar. However she wanted me to get bloodwork before starting me on lithium to see my levels in various things. She said she was going to diagnose me official with unspecified mood disorder until she saw my results regarding my thyroid. 

I was pretty bummed hearing this news, she essentially told me I had bipolar disorder but lacked whether it was I or II, so I still felt lost but like I was on the right track.

Well, my blood work came back and everything was normal except I had extremely low vitamin D and B-12. My psychiatrist called me and gave me dosage for otc vitamins. I read into the situation wrong and assumed she was just reducing my issues down to deficiencies.

I know these two deficiencies do not explain mania. Maybe vitamin D explains psychosis, but I don’t experience this. I felt like everyone was so sure I was bipolar and led me on to thinking I had a solution, and I think this issue runs deeper than just supplements.

I know many mental illnesses have links to vitamin deficiencies, and I guess my confusion comes from whether or not anyone else experienced this along with being bipolar. I have an appointment on Thursday, first one since bloodwork, and was wondering if I should mention the bipolar diagnosis if she doesn’t.

TLDR; is my doctor reducing her diagnosis to needing vitamin d and b-12? Can this and bipolar coincide? ";1695;92;255;57;23;564;197;370

60;bipolarreddit;albinocobra;04/04/2018;Near death experience that wasn’t real So I’m bipolar (if that wasn’t obvious from the get-go) and I was coming home from a trip with my Mom on a plane. I had a really amazing weekend and I was feeling happy but not manic but then I started getting very sad for no reason on the way home (just assumed it was another mood swing). Then, I had an extremely bad delusion where I was convinced that the plane was going to crash and we were all going to die. I was laying my head on my Mom’s shoulder, I told her I loved her, and I just silently cried while thinking about how this is the calm before the storm. In my head I was telling myself, I can’t believe we’re all about to die and I’M the only one who knows. I actually accepted death, and embraced it (not in a suicidal way) in a way that I had never ever done before and it was like I finally felt at peace. I had emotions that I had never come close to. When we experienced turbulence I closed my eyes and thought “this is it, this is when it happens” and waited for the screaming and the overhead announcements. I thought of the baby crying and how it never got to experience it’s life and how my mom would never finish her book, how my sister would react when she found out her closest family had died. After we landed safely I felt a weird mix of disappointment and relief. I didn’t want to die- but I had expected it to happen so much it felt wrong that it didn’t. After that I got that post-delusion state where everything kind of feels like a dream for awhile. But now I feel like I had a near-death experience that wasn’t real and I’m not sure how to move on from it. I feel like I should’ve gone down with that plane and now life just seems a little off. ;1346;39;286;18;28;448;167;355

I've been diagnosed with OCD (at 14) ADHD (19) Social Anxiety (19) and Depression (14ish), though I had struggled with all of these since I was a kid, but got worse at puberty. I was on Luvox from when I was 14 til 18 (I'm 20 now), just for OCD, and it had a moderate effect on that, sort of helped with my mood but barely touched my social anxiety, but I was stable(ish). Anyways, a year ago I went back after stopping the luvox because my symptoms all came back really bad with OCD and my depression, and the doc pointed out the other issues too. And I was given a Zoloft prescription, but I didn't take it for several months until everything became unbearable. I ended up stopping it after a week though, because I think I became a little manic almost when I took it, I had barely any sleep, full of energy, I was talking really fast (which is an achievement when I already talk fast), I felt amazing, though my head felt like it was about to explode, and then I started to worry that I was going to bite my tongue off (that was OCD), and then I became like scarily numb, and I stopped taking it because I was freaking out.
Point is, the past year, my OCD is much better and I have been in therapy for it, but my depression has just gotten worse, I had an episode at uni and then I dropped out, and I got better when I started fixing my social anxiety and met a guy, then after I broke up with a guy, my depression came back worse than ever, and when I was on Luvox, I got depressed, but these days I have a lot more suicidal thoughts and urges to hurt myself, which are becoming more and more frequent, so I'm going to ask for some antidepressants when I get my ADHD prescription refilled (she has said several times she wants to prescribe Lexapro but I refused).
Anyway, I was remembering what happened when I started the zoloft, and I had read that when people with diagnosed bipolar take antidepressants it can trigger an episode. My question is, is it possible that I do have bipolar and I've just mainly been depressed, or can meds trigger that even if you aren't bipolar? I'm just a little worried I don't want to fuck up my life any further than I have, and I just needed to ramble a bit.

I was already doing weight watchers and since September I’ve lost 21 lbs, but I’ve got about 70 more to go - this is a result of an episode that was triggered by going through a lot of life changes in a short period of time. The weight has caused me to have severe social anxiety. 

My doctor has known me since before I gained the weight and knows what a struggle it’s been. She knows this weight is not normal for me but as a result of the self-medicating with food. I see her again in a week or so since medications are changing.

I’m at a loss here guys...I’ve been in a horrible, predominantly manic mixed episode for two weeks now. My stress tolerance is zero. I wake up energetic and motivated but that quickly turns into me being irritable, irrational and frantic. It’s become so predictable and routine in the last two weeks I know how it goes. Every day around noon something small will set me off. It’s like this overwhelming amount of intense, frantic emotion has been building up all morning and then it’s just too much. Suddenly I’ll be having a panic attack or bawling because of an overwhelming sense of despair and heartbreak. It physically breaks me down. As soon as it happens, it ruins any chance of getting any more work done for the day (I work from home, self-employed). 

Inevitably I force myself to take my “I give up” pill...Klonopin...and sit there crying, shaking and paranoid until it kicks in. Then I lay in bed. I avoid my phone or computer because the slightest reminder of the responsibilities I have and am shirking sends me spiralling into a cycle of self/hatred, panic and desperation to be rid of these expectations and responsibilities. This meltdown lasts until I am emotionally exhausted and end up just laying there...numb...except for the twinge of the feeling that suicidal ideation brings. I don’t know what feeling it is...relief that there could be a way out? That is quickly followed by a wave of guilt and hopelessness that hits me like a fucking brick for thinking of putting my family through that after everything they’ve done for me. 

Sometimes by supper time, the whole ordeal is over and now I’m just depressed...it’s more manageable depression though. The kind that blinds me from seeing any hope in the future at all, but that I can at least watch a meaningless tv show to distract myself. By 8:00 my mind starts racing again, flooded with ideas on how to “fix” my life and do better tomorrow...I convince myself that if I just do _____ tomorrow maybe I can prevent it from escalating like it did today. Maybe meditation, taking my clonazepam earlier, setting more realistic goals, minimizing any stressors, journaling...or changing careers, going to school, moving, getting a divorce...the list goes on. If I’m careful and lucky for the rest of the night, nothing will shatter that illusion of hope for the next day. If not, I cry myself to sleep. 

I’ve never had an episode that is this predictable. It makes it all the more frustrating that I can’t do anything about it...if I know what’s coming, why can’t I do something to prevent it from escalating? Why can’t I cope better? I’m almost certain tapering off of the last antidepressant I was on (Trimipramine) triggered the episode...but I spent months tapering down and followed my psychiatrists directions to the tee. I know the Trimipramine was possibly suppressing some of the effects of my other medications as well and that the doses likely need to be tweaked now that I’m off it, but my psychiatrist is gone for two more weeks. I will just have to wait it out. The timing is horrible, I’m a full-time artist and I am in a show in two weeks that I need to finish preparing for. I need it to go well and if this continues I’m just not going to have the inventory to make it a profitable show...and damn do I need the money right now. Saying all that, maybe it’s stress induced and coming off the antidepressant is just amplifying everything. 

If you read though all of that... thank you. I don’t have anyone to talk to right now. I do have a supportive partner and family but I can only put so much of my shit out there before I start feeling like a burden to them.  Feeling like that doesn’t help anything.";3176;130;585;56;61;1026;326;764

87;bipolarreddit;angelluxie;23/01/2019;"What did you wish you knew sooner? If you could go back and tell yourself (or someone newly dx) advice about living with BP that you wish you knew then, what would that be?

I would say:

 Sometimes all you can do is endure an episode until it passes.  It might not get better yet despite doing everything right to take care of yourself and that isn't failure.  You're doing the work.  

Know what's at stake.  Mental illness can take whatever it wants and never give it back.   Your hopefulness and dedication can save you

Gather at least one or two people you can tell when you're becoming unwell, with whom you can ""just be"".  Whether that's a space to talk, a couch to lie on, monitor you, wellness check ins, people who know when to call your doctor or 911.

be honest with care providers about how bad it is.   Showing up well when you are not well is preventing you from getting necessary care.

Some people won't stay in your life because of what happens when you're sick.  It will hurt.  This has nothing to do with your worthiness of love and care and connection.  You're not bad.

There will be terrible regrets for what you have done while unwell.  One of the few ways I have found to heal is to dispel the crippling shame with whatever forgiveness and empathy.  I will do right in the future.  I am going to win. 

Of course... All of these come to me while I'm in remission and experiencing wellness.  

Thank you for reading.  I'm hoping to learn from all of you who respond.

That those people would end up with scrambled brains. At first,  I was incredibly embarrassed and upset. However,  I decided that I needed to say something (I'm reasonably close with the other colleagues present,  although they don't know about my BP,  they know I've had depression etc). I told this individual that I take lithium and I suffered from depression and Ocd as a teenager. He asked me if I was worried about taking 'something they use in batteries' and I explained that there are many chemicals that are broadly used and that taking lithium helps me to be the best version of myself. Everyone was kind of awkward and I told them that it wasn't something to worry about and that mental health issues need to be discussed openly. The colleague later came and apologized incase they had offended me.

97;bipolarreddit;AnotherCrazyChick;20/01/2018;"My Checkup Was A Success (Long Post) **The background story:** Since I was diagnosed over 10 years ago, I've needed continuous/ongoing treatment and consultation. Changing dosages, trying new medication, talking through the most current triggers, how to recognize, avoid, cope, and foster healthy decisions. Gone through 4 doctors... when I was able to get an appointment and afford the treatment. I've gone some years withdrawing, some entirely unmedicated, new medication, lower dose/higher dose, self medicating at times. Having bipolar is truly debilitating and scary. Emotional (Mood) symptom wise, last year was not as intense as I've experienced before. But last year was indeed the shittiest fucking year I have lived through in my entire life thus far. I won't list everything that was shitty. You guys know last year was horrible. My Mom almost dying before her liver transplant probably topped my list though. And my bipolar mania has decided to manifest entirely through my secondary symptoms of OCD. Chronic anxiety has taken over my usual depression and has crash landed directly on one main symptom. [Self Excoriation/dermatillomania/compulsive skin picking.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excoriation_disorder) No exaggeration, I look like the picture in that Wikipedia link, just add breasts and some curves. I'm not looking for advice or guidance. I've been receiving the professional version steadily over a year and a half now. I just know that CSP is not common in this sub, is often not associated with bipolar, and is still considered co morbid along with symptoms of OCD.

**The point of my post.:** I saw my psychiatrist today. And he agreed that I have had very significant improvements since I last saw him. My episodes have been less frequent, less intense, and my depression has also eased up. My mania still keeps me awake throughout the week (I get 3-4 hrs sleep at a time around 4-7am.) and I literally sleep all weekend. But my job hasn't been suffering, I've made three trips from the west coast to Texas for some extremely intense circumstances, I've lost 30lbs, and reduced my ""skin picking"" from my legs and lower arms to just my upper arms, back, and face although my face has had dramatic improvements as well. 

**My checkup Achievement:** For the first time since I can remember, my doctor isn't changing my medication and has said that I don't need to schedule a follow up appointment at this time. I will continue to have a steady supply of my personal med cocktail without worrying about running out. I'm under no obligation to pay for, schedule, drive to, or stress about coordinating  my life around another psych appointment until I feel it's necessary.

**TLDR: Some years/some decades are worse than others. If you can't remember the last time you caught a break, don't give up. We all deserve peace and stability. Today was my day.**";2308;113;353;59;54;727;276;495

He's always been a very good professional and never made me feel uncomfortable. Considering that I've known how he approaches therapy for 2 years now, I find it very strange that he has suddenly changed our boundaries - and without asking me. 

First thing, is that one day instead of a good bye handshake he said ""I'm going to hug you today"", and he did so. I didn't mind (goodbye hugging is very common in my culture) but I don't like that he didn't ask first if that was ok instead of just announcing it and going for it. 

He proceeded with doing this again after every session since then. Then last time he kissed me on the cheek (also common and non-sexual way to say goodbye in my culture) but still strange as he's never done it before. He also called me once to check on me and ask how I was feeling (I had just lost my dad so maybe that's fine) but he's also never done that before all these years. 

Today I cancelled our next appointment because something came up, and he said ok but I have to pay for it anyway, which I know some therapists do but 1) mine never does and 2) I cancelled way earlier than the timespan that would require me to pay. 

What is going on here? Is this an approach I'm not aware of, is something wrong?

I know this comes with the illness. And I know that I’m going to be OK. But in the meantime I’d really like to stop crying and feeling like my life doesn’t matter. 

I feel very alone even when I am around other people.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me anymore.

I don’t remember how I ended up like this.

I’m so frustrated because the last three years I had so many horrible things happen. 

I’m trying to get myself under control.

I take my medicine but it doesn’t seem to work.  I change it. That will  work for a few weeks. Then I have to move on to something else.

 I don’t take Xanax or Clonopin. Only because my doctor doesn’t want me to become dependent on them. I don’t know. I guess a lot of people become addicted. I don’t have an addictive personality that I’m aware of. But Vistaril doesn’t work. 

I smoke a lot of pot and that helps but where I’m from it’s not really something you can admit. And its something I can get arrested for but it’s also on of the few things that calm me down enough to be rational.

Right now I feel stable but I’m all over the place. I was switched from latuda to vraylar in December, and my doctor added 1 mg klonopin up to 2x a day and 100 mg trazodone. My meds I’m still on, and was on before is 500mg depakote 3x a day, lexapro 5 mg, and temazepam 30 mg. So I’m on a lot of meds and I was putting a lot of faith into trying this vraylar since it’s supposed to treat mixed episodes, and some of my symptoms have dissipated or gone away like I’m not as physically and mentally agitated, and my thoughts have slowed a bit, but I’m still having these outbursts of rage where I feel completely out of control and aggressive, and then I feel shame and embarrassment because I have no impulse control when, and leading up to these outbursts, and before. I had to move back home with my mom a couple weeks ago because I quit/was sort of pushed out of my job in December because my episode was escalating and I couldn’t manage my caseload. My boss was a social worker and said she’d call me in January to see if I was ready to come back to work and she never did so I just figure that my job I’ve built my career around is now just obsolete because of my circumstances for leaving. I blew all my savings in December and January by going on a trip to Vegas and then other stupid shit. 

I’m not hearing things anymore like I was, but my thoughts are disorganized and I’m not sure if my thinking is accurate. I ruined most of my relationships with people within a few weeks in December, so I’ve been isolating myself from the people I do know, but I still keep putting myself in not-so-ideal circumstances with people I don’t really know or really care to be around if it weren’t for the impulse to do some of these things. I don’t know why I can’t control this. The klonopin and trazodone aren’t cutting it for sleep. I’m supposed to use the klonopin and temazepam and trazodone together, but apparently there’s been a shortage of temazepam so I haven’t been able to fill that since early December.

My therapist and psychiatrist have been trying to keep me out of the hospital, but I’m starting to feel crappy and just kind of weak feeling. I cry nearly everyday, which is very abnormal for me, and I feel like I can’t eat so my body’s starting to feel like shit. 

My therapist brought up the prospect of ECT today. I’m 25 and the thought that I’m already having to escalate to even having that kind of conversation was terrifying to me. I know it has advanced over the years, but it’s still kind of scary. She also said if I don’t seem better next week she’s probably going to hospitalize me. I’m so exhausted from it all and tired of going several nights with no sleep that I don’t care anymore, but I think that means I probably don’t need to go then. I also read relapses happen within a year for most people even with successful ECT treatments. I’m just feeling so worthless.

Has anyone had ECT treatments? Did it actually help? Or just any advice in general? 

Thanks ";2490;102;500;47;44;819;252;629

117;bipolarreddit;athousandsuns0;01/01/2018;"As a woman in my early twenties, how do I build my trust in men and confidence in romantic relationships? Just in need of some advice. I am finally doing quite well dealing with being bipolar II (diagnosed a year ago), but I am finding some issues that are making themselves more apparent as I lean back in to the dating scene. Not only do my mental health issues make me nervous going into a relationship, but I am noticing I have some real trust issues. 

My father was an alcoholic most of my life and was not present very often. I have not had many men in my life that I have been able to fully trust. I know where my trust problems come from, but I am having trouble working on these issues. Anytime I meet a new guy and things are great, as soon as they mention a good friend that is a girl, my stomach just drops and I begin wondering if I can trust them. 

My first serious boyfriend also ended up dating his “good friend” right after we broke up and I think that is kinda adding to this thought spiral.

I guess I’m asking how can I come to terms with the fact that a guy could be unfaithful? Because of course I can never know for sure. How do I deal with that possibility without it making me push the person away out of fear? I get the worst feeling in my body just thinking about being in a relationship with someone and finding out that they secretly are very attracted to their friend that they just can’t be with for whatever reason. 

Please help:( I want to have a positive relationship in my life but I am getting in the way of that. ";1218;41;233;18;20;399;166;304

After the first 2 days I was very manic; creating a lot, no sleep, the usual suspects. Then very recently—3 days ago— I started getting into a depressive episode. Yesterday I used my positive coping skills to help deal with it, felt better but then had a very sudden onset of panic attacks. Today was no different. Panic attacks after every 3 hours. I hung out with the same friend, and they didn’t really do anything to cause it, nor did anything else. 

Also, in my manic states I have quite the sexual appetite and in my depressive episodes I usually ignore the avoidance symptoms (dumb, I know) and have sex anyways. Recently however the thought of ANYONE having any type of sex (friends talking about experience, me imagining etc) has triggered panic attacks.

122;bipolarreddit;auspiciouslyanon;11/04/2018;"Went on 2mg Abilify exactly 7 days ago as of today. I've gained 7 pounds. I am a 32 year old woman who was RX'd Abilify 2mg last week and began taking it a week ago today. I take it with 30mg lexapro, which i've taken for several years with no weight gain at all.

I am naturally very thin and always have been under weight. I have 
never had to worry about my weight...until now being on an AAP. I don't even own a scale and borrowed my roommate's today to find out my weight today and last week. The day I began the meds, 7 days ago, I was 117lbs, and am now 124.5. I am still within the healthy benchmark for my height at 5'6. 

However, given that it's only been a week and its 7 pounds, that's a lot, isn't it? I am excited to be a bit curvier and filled out, but I worry about how unhealthy this rapid increase could be, as diabetes runs in my family and I worry this medication will affect my health and metabolism negatively.

This now is the ultimate incentive to exercise (as i was infrequent) and eat few calories/carbs than before. I used to be someone who could eat anything and be rail thin. 

I'm hoping the effects of Abilify will out weigh the bad. I found that on day 5 of taking it, which was this Monday, was the first day I really felt like it was beginning to make me feel better. So far, I find myself in a happier mood and my coworkers today told me I seem happier and asked me if something good or different happened. I didn't have an answer! I am now not scowling or irritable like I was. I am able to smile at people in my building now at work, when I wasn't able to before.

I'm curious to find out from other women what their weight gain has been like on Abilify. Were you able to control your weight eventually while still taking it? Or did you have to stop taking it in order to loose weight? Has anyone been able to loose weight after stopping it?";1461;43;304;27;23;499;189;385

I’m on 100mg now and have been for 9 days. I’m not feeling any better. Just before the increase I was very nearly in crisis (low) hence the increase. Now I’m struggling to get as good quality sleep.

130;bipolarreddit;Baafsk;03/03/2019;"Feeling 'normal'... But that scares me a bit. My GP still haven't put me on mood stabilizers. I am only on Sertraline till my next appointment. Which sent me on a bad, bad manic episode. My first episode which felt as real and dangerous as it could, to the point I have a scar on my face because I'd cut it. That is how serious it was. I didn't spent money nor had sex, I was however extremely paranoic, had too much energy, was hallucinating, my self-esteem was sky-high... At the time it was good, but now that I am back to myself... I am terrified of it. I hate it. Every moment of happiness I am scared that shit is starting again. 


However, now, I am... Fine. I am not depressed. Which I was expecting, because I would always crash. I had an horrible depression that lasted 4 years, and it was packed with anxiety and panic attacks... It messed me up. I didn't finish school, nor do I have a job. I am a 23 yo that can't get its life right because of a crippling depression and anxiety. But for the very first time ever since my 13s (yes, I had panic attacks this long), I am feeling fine. But this is scary? I am not sure if Sertraline is dealing with my depression and is doing a good job at it. But the fear of getting manic again because of Sertraline is making my anxiety peak at night. Last night I woke up 4 times because I was hearing my dad call me, and then it was my mom, but really they weren't saying things... It was my imagination. But while I feel fine, this fear is so, so bad. I always think ""am I hallucinating again?"". 



Thoughts like ""in a few days I will either be depressed or manic again"" makes me extremely worried. And so is my family. They are very supportive, and they felt so powerless last time it scared them to death. Every time I say ""I am so happy today"" my mom asks me if I had a good night of sleep or if I am feeling like a bit high. Same for my sister and my dad. Questions like ""You okay? For real?"" is turning out to be too common.

131;bipolarreddit;baboperson;14/02/2019;"Loved Ones with Bipolar I am unsure if there already is a post on how to cope with loved ones with bipolar.  Please let me know if there is. 

 My husband was hospitalized about 5 months ago and it's been a roller coaster since with finding which meds work, finding a permanent psychiatrist, going to therapy, etc.  His bipolar is affecting our marriage and it's like he's completely forgotten his life skills. We are seeing a marriage counselor very soon.  Right now I am the only one working but luckily I make enough for the two of us to be living okay.  It just gets overwhelming when I have to literally do everything on top of working full-time.  We got a puppy as an ESA, which has helped tremendously.  I only agreed to get the puppy to help him when I am at work and he did say he'd do most of the work of caring for the puppy, but I am the one that ended up caring for the puppy a majority of the time.  I grew up with no pets. He grew up with dogs his whole childhood, so getting used to a dog was difficult when he just got out of the hospital. It's fine now since I've caught on quick with caring for a dog.  

It gets so exhausting with his mood changes. The smallest things upsets him and keeps him in a depressed/unhappy mood for awhile.  For example: I was  tired from work and didn't feel like going out to get food. Initially I did agree to get food but thought he was going with me, but I forgot his back had been hurting all day.  I got home and didn't feel like going back out.  He got so upset because he was hungry and he didn't want to eat what was at home. He has zero cooking skills and will always order food or grab fast food.  He doesn't like going out in public, which I understand.  But when he gets upset, I can't do anything at all. If I go to a different room, he says I don't care about him. If I want to do something to lighten the mood, he tells me to stop because I am not doing it appropriately for his bipolar at the moment. When it gets too much, I break down and start crying. He automatically makes me feel guilty by saying, ""I'm always the bad guy.  You can never do anything wrong.""  Anything I say is used against me when he's upset. He somehow finds ways to twist what I say to have a different meaning.

When he is back in a good mood, we reflect on his behavior and how I reacted. He is reasonable when he's happy. He admits he was an asshole.  I know it's his bipolar, but I don't know what to do anymore and am exhausted of this endless cycle.  I've told him before when he's experiencing an episode, I always feel like he's gas lighting me. I honestly can't tell the difference between bipolar and gas lightining anymore with him.  

TLDR: I just want to know if there is some support group for people with loved ones living with bipolar";2168;76;449;32;38;721;240;563

Essentially went MIA because I felt like everyone around me was treating me like I was crazy.

When I was with her, she kept me on Lamotrigine, the generic one, got me up to 200-something mg. I also was prescribed some Stilnox which was totally awesome if not for my shitty depressive episodes where I would try to sleep all the time and all the mania where I just wanted to hallucinate all the time. Anyway! The Lamotrigine made me feel so fucking awful. I was a zombie for the longest time. Felt no emotions, no sex drive, I was pretty absent as a girlfriend (which led to the demise of a really great relationship), no motivation to do anything from work to studies, et cetera. It wasn't working so she kept up-ing the dose and also asked me to take some Inderal to calm down the increasing anxiety I had.

I stopped seeing her, as I've mentioned. It wasn't just the medicine, but it was also because I just didn't feel comfortable speaking to her anymore. She wasn't super awful or anything. There were just subtle instances where I would feel shitty about some things she'd say. 

Since the break up, I realized I needed to get help because I was so not mentally healthy at all. I stopped seeing her in the middle of my relationship because of reasons listed above, but also because I refused to believe that there was something wrong with my brain. I just wanted it to all go away and convince myself I was normal. Currently trying some different doctors, looking for The One. 

Meanwhile - This is probably not advisable, but because I can't wait between appointments, I started self medicating. Went totally sober. No alcohol, no cigarettes, no weed (which apparently turns BPD people schizophrenic or something? Which sucks because it was so great for the anxiety), no popping benzos - or any other drug. Started working out more consistently. Controlled my eating. I went back on the Lamotrigine BUT this time I started taking the branded GSK Lamictal. Started with 50mg. I paired it with 10mg of Inderal. I FELT SO GREAT!!!! I was having episodes all the time, but this calmed me down in a non-zombie way. I started building a tolerance to it though - I think? My anxiety would come back worse. Weeks into this routine, I went up gradually to 250mg of Lamictal and 40mg of Inderal. I'm feeling really great. I know it's not mania. I just feel healthy and normal. I think it's helping me keep to my routine, cope with my break up, be more productive. I'm on my way to becoming a better person I think.

145;bipolarreddit;bchris10sen4;12/02/2019;"Does anyone else have difficulty accepting your diagnosis when hypomanic or manic? I am a 30 year old psychiatric RN, I was first diagnosed with bipolar I when I was 23 years old.  In retrospect I may have had 1-2 manic episodes before then- I was medicated a short time, felt better and then I talked myself out of my diagnosis.  I would tell myself that I was just stressed and unhappy with my life so I was essentially just rebelling.  It wasn't until what I believe to be my 3rd or 4th spring/summer manic episode that I sought treatment because I could see the cycle.  
Context:  My first episode I had been married for 5 years (got married to a man in the army when I was 18), I had two children who were 3 and 5 at the time.  A lot had changed, I was going to nursing school which was terribly stressful, I was drinking a lot and smoking a lot of pot.  My husband was lazy as fuck and would lay around all day and expect me to come home from a day of school and work and do all the shit around the house.  Anyway, I began to say things to him like ""you're not my father"", ""I'll do what I want, I'm an adult"", ""If I want to go out with my friends I will"".... Which are things I had never said to him before... but I started to feel like my life wasn't enough and I needed more.  So I started with the sexual symptoms, I was reaching out to plenty of people, men, women... everyone, my boss, his son... and I started doing really shitty things.  One time I told my husband I was leaving to pick up a friend and I ended up going to a party and getting fucked up and never came home that night... and I had a lot of nights where I drank in excess and can't recall the events... Needless to say, by the end of the summer I had looked my husband in the face and told him without any feelings whatsoever that I did not love him anymore and I was moving out.  He was DEVASTATED and I didn't care.  I took my two kids and moved into an apartment.  He would say things like, HOW do you not care? It wasn't until I came down from that episode that I realized how fucked up my choices were and actually cried about my massive life change.  

Episode 2:  I had remarried by then, I had just had the second child with my new husband.  I was terribly stressed with work and kids and I felt like my husband and I were on two separate pages and I began to resent him.  He was controlling and possessive and I began to say the same things ""You're not my dad"" ""don't tell me what to do"" ""im a professional, I go to work, I make good money, don't restrict my life"".... and I began to get sexual and unfortunately I was working in juvenile corrections at the time and I was a woman amongst a whole lot of men.... So as you can imagine that ended badly... so my husband caught me in some bad predicaments and I ended up telling him I didn't love him and I was moving out and done.  I took my kids and rented a house down by the lake in September.  By Christmas I had realized I fucked up and my husband was more than willing to take me back and work on things so I moved back home. 

Episode 3: Husband and I had been working on our marriage, I was being really restricted at this point because he couldn't trust me... I was still kind of denying my diagnosis so I never brought that up to him and he just thought I was a terrible, no good, lying, cheating person... so he kept very good tabs on me and asked me a lot of fucking questions and it got old really fast... so some summer time.... I began feeling great, increased sexual drive, defiant and making the same statements. was drinking every day, smoking an eighth of weed every day, rolling blunts on my way to work and smoking before during and after work to get by... it was terrible looking back on it.. I had many nights where I didn't go home, I would stay with friends or ""sleep"" in my car...  I had about 4 police contacts that summer, I could have easily ended up with 2 DWIs, I did have a harassment charge for punching someone, and I had 2 welfare checks because people were so worried about my erratic behavior. I had friends and family expressing their concern for me but once again I thought everyone else was crazy and needed to leave me alone because I was successful, made it to work, work performance was ok, and I still took care of my kids when it was my day to do so.  My husband grew tired of my behavior quickly, obviously... so we were talking about splitting up again...I fell so hard from this one... I ended up being caught with a belt around my neck in the garage after calling my ex to come pick up my older two kids- the other two weren't home.  That's why I decided I needed treatment... 

I fell from the last episode in October, 2018.  It's now February and I usually start to trend up in the spring and I am anticipating it.  I have trended my timeline and disease symptoms... I have red flags in place with my loved ones.  One of them is wanting to drink... I haven't drank since September- and I know when I start to want to drink is not a good sign... but anyway, ive been thinking about drinking.... and I haven't said anything to anyone because I guess I am trying to convince myself that I can..
I'm also starting to resent my husband again... he's controlling and manipulative and I don't think he understands my illness and he holds things against me... during my manic episodes everything is spinning out of control so fast that I can recall certain events but to put a timeline I really cant... like I know I did something but I don't know where it fits in and some minute details, that's hard for him to accept.  he thinks im withholding information from him or lying.. and I can only tell him the same thing so many times before it's just maddening to me... 
I'm currently on a med regime and it's hard for me to accept the amount of chemicals I put into myself every day.  I take Wellbutrin, Depakote (needs to be increased I assume), buspar, Vyvanse, and atarax. 
OK, back to the original question, am I the only one who tries to convince themselves that they're misdiagnosed? EVEN THOUGH I know that I am capable of ruining my entire life and everything I've worked so hard for, I'm intelligent, I work in the psych field and I am still trying to talk myself out of having to deal with this bullshit forever!!

I am graduating from nursing school in May. I already have a job lined up on a floor where I already work as a secretary. I've always worked days. When I start working as an RN, I'll probably have the option to work days (7am-7pm) or nights (7pm to 7am). I still don't know which to choose. I know that working nights is generally a bad idea when you have a mental illness because it messes up your circadian rhythm. But days are faster paced and higher stress and I know that high stress is also bad I you have a mental illness. Either way, I'm screwed, but I really want this job.

The training program includes a strict meal plan and weekly weigh-ins. If you lose 20 lbs in 6 weeks then you get all your money back. Unfortunately, it's triggered my eating disorder and now I'm restricting like a mofo.

The first class I went to, I had to sit out part of the time because I almost passed out. I've done 3 classes so far and it's incredibly embarrassing when I have to take a break to sit down while everyone else is still up and punching their bags.

I know I shouldn't compare myself to everyone else, because I'm just a beginner and they might not be, but I can't help it.

158;bipolarreddit;Beibi_nugget;11/02/2018;"Bipolar and shrooms Hi just last year I was diagnosed bipolar type II. I'm not really clear on my diagnose since I've never been on a manic state, my psychiatrist says I have hypomania. But the truth is that most of the time I'm really depressed. I get triggered by an ongoing relationship with a friend that used to be my boyfriend but now just see each other from time to time and have sex. We love each other but kind of in a friendly way. This new relationship dinamic that has been going on since December last year, has been a real struggle for me since I really don't want to loose his support and love and sex. It means a lot to me maybe the only thing that keeps me going on. Most of the times we don't talk during the week and I wait for him to talk to me, this makes me very sad and it triggers my depression. 
Not long ago I decided that I wanted to do shrooms. 6 years ago I did them but I was naive and a fool, I did a very low dosage and I was a very different person from now, I didn't get very much insight. 
Now I would like to consult with magic shrooms, 1 gram to start off. 
Last year has been a rollercoaster for the meds. Right now I'm taking 250 mg of lamictal, topamax 25 mg 3 times a day, risperidal 0.5 mg and 200 mg of quietapine. 
I'm really open to all suggestions, I'm hoping this can be an eye opening experience that will help me in the future, maybe help me being so dependant on relationships.
I'm thinking about doing this with a friend we would like to do it on a place with lots of nature. The first time I did it was on the woods and I was really happy and connected to the greenery of the forest. Please let me know your opinions

Edit: please so that you may understand a little bit more about my relationship. I do not feel like I'm in a bad relationship. In fact we have a great dinamic and connection and we understand and love each other. We decided to stop labeling as girlfriend/boyfriend because right now it can bring so much stress in this period of our life's. It my case it was making me enter into a very dependant attitude and he was sucking up all of that energy and getting depressed too. So we decided to break up, stop seeing each other with the same frequency, start acting more like friends, and when we see each other  indulge in sex as a natural and healthy activity and enjoy or spend some time together watching movie, hiking on the nature. So if you see we have been doing this maybe 2 months or so. We see each other every 2 weeks or 1 week. He tells me that this year's that he is focused on creating and expanding his work not really looking for a girlfriend and I do believe him so when he tells me this. I'm really on the same boat with this, I just got a good paying job, I'm painting, eating healthy, taking my meds, exercising a bit, sleeping on time.
He will be travelling on June maybe to Europe 3 months and it will be tough for me but I think that that time will be a deciding period for me to think things over. I will miss him very much but it will make me a tougher woman I'm 28 but sometimes I still feel like a little afraid girl. I'm still very positive that everything will turn all right and that even with him or without him I'm going to be okay. Today I woke up in a good mood. :)";2561;82;538;52;43;854;268;665

167;bipolarreddit;bibibirdie5678;06/01/2019;"Tardive Dyskinesia, medication adjustments and the manic aftermath. Hi everyone, 

It’s hard to know where to start. I started medication for bipolar as an adolescent (13 I think) but I have been bipolar since I was a young child, and it feels like there is nothing before it. I am entering my late twenties now (so still young) but as you may know even in my childhood there was a lot of controversy about whether children could be bipolar and very little known about medicating children for being bipolar. I did have a child psychiatrist and I sincerely believe he did the best he could for me. That being said, everything was sort of a stab in the dark. I am sure there are many of you who can relate. 

It turns out that a good psychiatrist is hard to find around here, so the next one I went to missed a medication interaction between a non psychiatric medication I was already on and lamictal. He also happened to miss my signs of tardive dyskinesia even though I brought them to his attention several times. I no longer see him. I am no longer on lamictal. 

I now see a new psychiatrist and she is fantastic. I am in good hands and trust that, but she had to bring me down from a fairly standard dose of Abilify I have been on for the past 14 years to basically almost nothing because of the tardive dyskinesia. I was fine at first, surprisingly fine and stable, but now I have been manic/hypomanic for a couple of weeks when I was pretty well managed before. 

I see my psychiatrist in three days. I plan to talk to her and come up with a plan to deal with this at that appointment. 

It’s just at my last appointment, before the mania started, we talked about my choices and my medication options are now limited based on what did not work for me before and especially now thanks to developing TD and I am just scared. There may be some major changes to my medication. 

I have started this amazing life with this amazing girl. I have a stable job. We are getting married next year. We have a home. We have cats. We have a future. We want kids. I am scared because although she has seen me in bad moments and knows of my past, she has not truly experienced me at my worst. I know she will always love me but I am terrified- terrified of the td getting worse. Terrified of feeling out of control again. 

I don’t really know what I expect from any comments. I suppose I just needed to say this to people who would understand how I feel. Most people I know and talk to don’t get it at all. They have not lived it. I needed to confide in people who struggle with what I struggle with. 

It’s like my life that I worked so hard to build and maintain since I was a child (with consistent therapy, with medication, and with A LOT of everyday effort) is going to be ripped out from under me and it’s not even my doing. I did everything right. It hurts. It’s scary. It’s a lot. 

Sorry this is so long. I hope there are still people willing to read it.

I had a what I'm assuming was a panic attack the other night cause I've only ever felt this sensation when I think really hard about some kind of medical condition I probably don't have. My vision went blurry, and my ears were hissing. I remember fumbling with my breathing while wondering wtf was happening. I started taking deep breaths after figuring I might be having a panic attack. I ignored all my emotionally rooted thoughts and calmed myself down. Fuck. That. Shit. I feel for anyone who goes through anything like that regularly. That is down right terrifying to the ""piss your pants"" core.

So, I've been stable for about 6 months now doing what I'm doing and actually being successful (how I perceive it anyways). I'm holding a job, I'm loved by my peers and getting along with my parents better than ever. I've matured a lot I guess, but being disciplined with my diet, meds, and sleep, have made it all stay together.

Just a couple weeks back my Mom got diagnosed with breast cancer... And I'm pretty sure the restaurant I'm working at is going to close soon because I've never seen a shit show like this EVER! Everyone is drunk and indifferent... It's sad.  Aaaaaaand now my ex wants to talk on the phone today (only have let her text me recently since making amends and healing our friendship). She's been sporadically contacting me telling me this or that reminded her of me... I really feel like she eventually (prolly not today) wants to try and rekindle things. She's expressed since finalizing our divorce how she feels she messed up and turned her back on me when I was simply severely depressed. I get that now and I understand why she did what she did, and he don't blame her for it one bit. But I can't trust her anymore like that. She'll prolly drop me when I hit another dip in my journey. 

I'm overloaded right now. But I'm staying disciplined and trying to do everything how I need to, to stay stable. It's working I guess, but man, this is the shitty part of life that usually puts me down for a year. I'm afraid, but I'm excited to challenge my will through these tough times.

 Oh yeah, I forgot in my rambling, my parents (whom I'm living with currently) are selling their house and moving to a different city. Overall a good thing for all of us, but keeping the house clean and sprucing it up for random showings today with a few hours notice is stressful.

169;bipolarreddit;BigBenHasAHen;03/02/2018;"I Found What I Was Looking For I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in April 2012. I've struggled with the illness since I was twelve-years-old, and initially I was diagnosed with unipolar depression. I've been hospitalized more than ten times. I've been suicidal countless times. Without my medication I experience so many manic breakdowns-breakdowns that are terrifying. 

I came to terms with my illness in October 2016, after losing someone that I love with all my heart. When this person severed our relationship, I realized that I needed my medication to make the paranoia, the delusions, and the recklessness go away. It was through this loss that I saw the light. 

But, it was as of recently that I realized the way I treated people and myself, and my perspective in life was also unacceptable. I have a strong support network, but I disclosed everything under the sun to anyone who would listen which is not good for anyone's self-esteem. 
I was the proverbial empty barrel that made noise-all the contents of my barrel would spill out into the ocean that is life. I was unable to love myself, so I sought that love in others. I revealed everything about myself in the hope that someone else could soothe my pain, only to scare away people that just wanted a healthy relationship with me. I am sharing my story because medication saved me from the mania, but it was mindfulness that saved me from myself. 

I realized all the love I need is within myself, and that I don't need to turn to others to soothe my emotions when meditation coupled with medication can lead one to find the peace and bliss we are all looking for.

171;bipolarreddit;bigoltrollmamma;18/01/2019;"Lamictical and depakote Okay! Sorry in advance on mobile. 

So June 1, 2018 I had my third child. I was diagnosed bipolar a few years ago and never really took eating healthy very seriously. After I had my third baby, I lost my mind. 

Anyways, we started working with a doctor and trying to find treatment. She started me off with lamictical (? Spelling) and I had never been happier! It worked wonderfully and it was the best two months of my mental health in a VERY long time (at least 10 years). While I was upping my doses slowly, I got the dreaded rash. So off of that. Since then I’ve been on at least 7 different kinds of medication and keep having to switch because of side effects ruining my life. (Everything from weight gain, to hallucinations). I still haven’t lost any of the weight that meds caused me to gain (at least 50 pounds). 

I went and saw my doctor today and she wants me to be on a mix of depakote (extended release because immediate didn’t work) and fluoxetine. 

I’m asking for any and all advice. Trying this many different meds in such a short amount of time is awful. It’s taking a toll on not just me, but my family. I need to get this crap figured out! I’m almost to a point where I don’t wanna be medicated at all because apparently?! None work for me. I’m so disappointed and discouraged. 

Has anyone had this cocktail of meds and had it work?

My uncle passed away Thursday, and he had a traumatic heartbreak which what probably heightened his mania some more.  He even beat his my nephew (same age as me) out of anger, and then apologized but went back to physical violence.

182;bipolarreddit;bipolaradvice;14/03/2018;"Some Questions From a Newly Diagnosed Bipolar Person Hey, I am 18 and male and diagnosed bipolar. 


Currently, the only things I am taking for my bipolar disorder are NAC and fish oil. 


I am also diagnosed adhd, so if some of this is irrelevant, to Bipolar disorder, I apologize in advance.


Onwards with the questions:


1. My psychiatrist has tried to prescribe my mood stabilizers (most recently lamotrigine), and I have refused to take them. I really enjoy the high feelings I get and don't want to give them up. I also am deathly scared of putting any drugs into my body. I do not even drink. Has anyone tried this drug? What has your experience with mood stabilizers been?


2. Some months, I legitimately cannot focus. Like, even reading for me is just not going to happen. I meditate every day, and during some months, getting my self to sit still is a near impossibility. I am a master level chess player, but I have to play multiple games at once to properly stimulate myself. I have found that intense exercise (especially weights and competition) help a bit. I have also used audiobooks. Does any have any other coping strategies when they cannot focus?


3. I am hypersexual. Like, it is all I think about. If I wasn't so busy with sports, academics, and music, I would probably sleep with a different girl at least every week. I don't even really enjoy it I just sleep with a girl within 30 mins of meeting her at a party or on a first date and then I feel like shit the next few days. Then, I think I really like her for a sec. Then next week I decided I am bored with her and it's on to the next girl. 


The only girl I didn't get bored of was this other girl I slept with who had bipolar disorder too. She was just crazy enough to keep things interesting. She got a boyfriend though.


I really want a stable relationship, but my habits seem to prevent that. On top of that, I have a horrible reputation because of the number of girls I have slept with and the way I have slept with them and used them mostly for sex (although I have always had consent and never slept with even a tipsy girl).


How do you guys hold down a stable relationship? It seems hopeless with hypersexuality, boredom, and mood instability. Speaking of which:


    4. How do you deal with loneliness? I have many friends, but I still get lonely. I use sex to cope but that is clearly insufficient. A relationship would be ideal, and I am working on it, but is there anything else I can do?


    5. How have you reconciled giving up these manic episodes when they are so appealing not just because of the emotions but also because you are better at everything, confident, and able to have life experiences you would never otherwise have.


    6. How do you explain to your friends when they ask if you are on drugs right now or comment that it is like you are either ""marijuana [your name] or meth [your name] depending on the week."" I don't want to tell them I am bipolar (and I didn't even know for sure until recently).";2340;89;435;52;47;782;259;568

I have been with my husband a good decade long and have been married a couple of years.

I get depressive low periods. I also get hypomanic, and when I do, I get extreme hypersexual symptoms that I act on, as I haven't found a means to curb the extreme intensity of it yet.

I've had a few extra curricular affairs.
But I have also been having an affair with my ex boyfriend that has lasted years.

I turn 50 tomorrow. Half of my life is gone, wasted...on being on disability, sick,  unproductive, contributing zero to this world. For 50 LONG years!

I’ve tried volunteering twice in the past year...neither ended up working out.

So, I’m totally alone.

I knew form the start about his state and I tried to inform myself about his disorder so I could better reach to him. At first we met he was in relathionship and I didn't knew that. We were just acquaintances, but we liked each other. He had that conversation with me, that he likes me and that he is in relathionship with that girl for one year and I told him that he shouldn't reconsider breaking up a serious relathinship just because he likes someone (in that case me) and after that it passed one month. We didn't had contact. 

Suddenly he showed up and it looked like he broke up. He told me that he is free and that he felt nothing for that girl, so we started dating. He looked really really in love with me and I sstarted to love him. We had a great relathionship and everything went just perfect. but for one year. Than he had that ""cold waves"", we called that state like that. As he told me he had for a very long time a big problem with retrospective jelosy. Sometimes it affected on us. And sometimes he had a periods when he, as he said- felt nothing to me, but that he cared for me. I gave him space and tried to understand and wanted him to be free to make decision if he wants to be with me. And our relathionship lasted one year like that. 

He never had a relathionship longer than one year. In our case we lasted for two years. But the second one was filled with all those ""cold waves"" he felt. And the last wave when we broke up I gave him a freedom again, but it seems like now that he really choose to move on and it looks like he really don't love me. 

He made an instangram page and now after 3 months of break up he posted a photo with a new girlfriend. I can guess he behave a little bit strange and that he is just in his mood swing. But we were perfect match in everything else. We got along very well. I feel like he is my true soulmate, despite his strange behaviour. 

Now I just reconsider if he ever really loved me? And maybe I  supposed to be more dedicated and try harder to keep us together? Maybe I could do something to keep him close?

When I was a teen, I used to habitually hallucinate at night, seeing shadows as things they weren't, picture things lurking in corners, hear things, etc. It kept me up for hours with lights on, hoping the images wouldn't become more vivid or real feeling. Most times they didn't. Sometimes they did.

Ever since I started getting medicated, though, my night vision has devolved into shit. I physically cannot see in the dark no matter what, not without a source of definitive light. 

While medication severely lessened hallucinations, it didn't rid me of them. I still fairly often hear things that aren't there. But night hallucinations? The inability to see has made them nigh impossible. 

Is it possible my brain decided to rewire itself a bit to make my life easier? I mean, it's done that before when I grew to be more introverted and self-sustainable socially, or re-conditioned  my conscious brain to want and need more sleep.

204;bipolarreddit;blanca8833;01/01/2019;Disgust with partner during depressive episode We all know the pattern: infatuation with new s.o. Then a few months later when depression kicks in they become the most annoying disgusting person. I'm aware it's the illness and it will pass, but once those thoughts are formed, the magic of the relationship is gone and I'm back to believing that I'm better off alone. It's too much work to push through the depressive period trying to make myself feel better and get out of the mood but also to convince my partner that it's all ok and I still like them. I simply want to be alone when I am depressed and it's annoying and a huge turn off to have to validate a partner when I am fighting tooth and nail not to jump off a bridge from the depression. Please talk some sense into me or tell me how you cope when this happens! ;659;24;128;12;11;211;105;162

208;bipolarreddit;BlueBoyBlitz;08/01/2019;"Anguish For the last three months I've been doing what I can to keep my anger and anxiety down to a minimum. Long story short I was asked to help an aquaintence with a project and when I divulged personal stories to them about things that I had guilt or fears about they decided to tell me it was my fault and then rub salt in the would be telling me I was a burden on them. I came home crushed and filled with rage and anger but mostly a feeling of guilt. Like I had done something wrong. Like maybe there was truth in their words. Logically I know there isn't. They never took the time to even listen to me and interrupted me constantly while never giving me a chance to think to respond, claiming that because I had to think I was about to lie and was unsure myself. 

Truth is, I just don't think of certain things that often. I had opened up to these people just to be kicked down, and for the last three months I've been filled with an uneasy rage and panic attacks whenever I think of them which has been daily. I've done everything I know to do to get them out of my head, but it only serves to strengthen the memory. I know that by giving them so much real estate in my head I'm giving them the power over me but I can't control it. I feel so hurt, and now it's starting to cause severe paranoia in my normal life making me laugh or at those I trust. I feel lost, helpless, useless and full of guilt but lost of all I feel like it is all my fault for not being able to cope. I have a history of trauma, bipolar, depression, and autism.

 I'm terrified of people and I don't know what to do anymore. I've resigned the idea of ever getting a job or of ever having a meaningful relationship. But know I wonder if having a standards life is out of the question as well.

The thought-process I'm describing is irrational by definition. I hope my post is taken in that spirit, rather than delegitimizing a different kind of disability by implying it's a lesser one.*

Talking about bipolar disorder, we focus on the trials and tribulations of hypo and manic episodes. Deservedly so, as no other mental state perhaps carries quite the same potential for leaving a scorched earth in its wake. The depressive states aren't exactly a case of the sniffles, though.

Dealing with my own psychopathology, I've come to fear depressive episodes more than I do the other side. Probably that's because I've only been fully manic a few times in my life, and the choices I make now when hypomanic aren't quite as destructive as when I was younger. 

My depressive episodes are pretty profound, though. Near-catatonia deep. It's strange, though, because suicidal ideation isn't something I often feel when I'm down in the black. What I do feel, and this has been a feature of my depression for years, is a morbid fixation with my eyes.

A bit of background: I've always had a *lot* of trouble with my eyes. When I was a kid I had to do these weird exercises to correct a lazy eye. Then I had to start taking these prescription eyedrops because my tear ducts didn't produce enough lubrication. Later on, I was diagnosed with Graves Disease (and autoimmune disorder involving the thyroid) and I started showing signs of developing Thyroid Eye Disease. I had surgery to correct that, which was thankfully successful. However, I became night blind, and my eyes became absurdly light-sensitive. I can't drive at night now, and if you see me during the day chances are good that I'm wearing sunglasses. Heh, people make fun of me because I own a few extremely expensive designer sunglasses, but fuck it. I figure if I'm going to be wearing something every day it may as well be well-made and make me feel good.

The thing is, when I'm in a depressive state I'll begin having intrusive thoughts about my eyes. Specifically, blinding myself. Putting sharp needles into my eyes. Using a pipette to put a drop of nitric acid onto them. Staring into the sun for hours/days. Take a lesson from the Oedipal myth and pluck them out with my hands. Things like that.

I've read literature regarding people who have strangely antagonistic ideas about certain body parts. In fact, I remember a story about a woman whose psychologist gave her tips to blind herself, and she did, and is apparently much happier now.

I don't think my eye thing is essentially a body dysmorphic thing the way it is for these other people. I've been trying to think of why that's the place my mind goes when in a depressive state, but I haven't quite figured it out. I feel like I should figure it out, as I feel that there's a strong non-zero possibility that I'll act on this at some point, which is a pretty fucked up way to feel.

My initial hypothesis is that I feel so sick inside, and that some disabling external situation would... somehow validate the internal state? An ugly thought, for sure.

Is the desire to or fixation on maiming oneself something that others with bipolar disorder feel? Perhaps it's just an oddity of my presentation.";2693;129;449;69;41;872;307;615
211;bipolarreddit;BluesBreaker013;07/01/2019;New here and seeking advice I’ve been on a mix of 1mg Clonazepam, 75mg of Venlafaxine (Effexor), and 200mg of Lamictil (god I hate spelling these) for about ten years now.

Just wanted to know what everyone's experiences were. I've had some pretty terrible experiences with medications in the past. Zoloft made me go manic (which is what caused my psychiatrist to realize that I probably have bipolar tendencies). Another one which I've had (I cannot remember the name of it -- it had two names, one started with an ""m"" and the other with a ""r"") caused weight gain. 

My main worry is any side effects -- particularly weight gain. I've gained the horrid freshmen 15 after starting college. Also, I've gone off of my Dexedrine (which majorly suppresses appetite) -- which I've been taking since I was eleven years old. It's hard to manage my appetite now that I actually feel hunger. 

I've also heard that lamictal can cause lethargy. I've actually been experiencing issues with insomnia (which I'm now taking ambien for, which I hope doesn't cause weight gain as well) and briefly went off of lamictal because I couldn't sleep. What have been the experiences of people that were made more energetic by lamictal? Did you still get the whole ""brain fog"" or anything? 

At what dosage did you guys start to notice changes?

When should I start worrying about the dreaded rash that I'm always told to fear for? I haven't gotten anything so far, but am I at too low of a dosage to feel safe about not having had any rashes? ";1245;46;228;30;19;406;159;295

Prior to this he was being treated for anxiety with zoloft. About a year ago he started smoking pot to help with the anxiety and convinced me that it was better for him than zoloft. As of last October he started zoloft AND weed. Since then he's had deep depression and some scary ""rages"".

He agreed to go see a psychiatrist and that's when he got the diagnosis. The doctor prescribed Latuda but he complained about extra anxiety, then when the dose went up to 40mg he had a severe reaction of akathisia and panic attack. 

So he stopped taking it and we have an appointment in a few days with the pdoc.

He keeps insisting that we find a drug with no side effects or he goes back to smoking. He thinks the doctor is stupid and isn't worried about how THC might make paranoia worse.

I don't think he knows just how irritable he is almost all the time. I walk on tiptoes worrying that something I say will trigger a 2 hour lecture. Looking at other med options it seems Seroquel might be better since it helps with anxiety but he looked at the side effect list and balked. 

How do I convince him to keep trying until he finds something that works for him? This seems like a catch 22, he thinks he's smarter than the pdoc but that belief would go away on the right med.

223;bipolarreddit;bpthroaway;12/03/2019;Is this normal psych hospital procedure? A few years ago on my 16th birthday I was sent to a psych hospital and stayed there for a week. Some things happened there that scared me and I'm not sure if it was standerd psych hospital procedure and I'm overeacting, or if their procedures are abnormal. I was voluntarily admitted due to bipolar disorder. I wasn't on the medicine I needed, and since it was an emergency, I went to the psych hospital. During my time there they had a skin check. At first I didn't know they were doing, they just told me to undress myself and be naked. They didn't ask if being naked in front of other people made me uncomfortable, they didn't ask if I was menstruating,  they didn't ask if I had been sexually assaulted. I was confused and thought they were going to sexually assault me, so I started crying. They then told me either I undress myself or they would restrain me. By then I was crying uncontrollably. I begged them to not make me undress myself. I let them touch under my clothes because I didn't want them to see my breasts. They forced me to take off my underwear which was uncomfortable since I was menstruating. It probably doesn't seem like much to be scared of, but when the only person you've allowed to see your private parts is your pediatrician due to yearly check-up and that it is required, and I have had the same pediatrician for several years so I trust her, it was a big deal to me. I was stuck at the hospital for a week, they said they would let me home on Friday but then said I had to stay over the weekend even though the insurance didn't cover weekends, so the hospital bill put my family in some debt. My family can afford a house, food, utilities and all that, but we aren't middle class, we get free lunch at school and help from the government. Hospital bills are notoriously high in the united states, and the medicine I'm on costs more in the united states than it does in third world countries and the developing world. My parents asked that I be released from the hospital, but their request was denied even though I was voluntarily committed. Also, the psych hospital had zero privacy. No locks on doors, the shower curtain was clear. Everyone had a roommate, mine treated me terribly, and so I was worried she'd come in when I was in the bathroom or showering and see me. The psych hospital was tiny, it was a hallway with rooms on each side, some bedrooms, a room to eat, and a desk where a lady gave you meds. They made you go to groups, but the medicine they put me on made me super tired and knocked me out. Best sleep I've had, but it made the nurses and doctors angry that I wasn't participating in groups and instead, sleeping. Or trying to sleep, rather, since the psych hospital was so small and crowded that every little noise echoed. I often hear people say psych wards make them feel safe and calm, but my experience was far from it. Is it normal for psych hospitals to be like this?;2353;86;454;49;32;760;256;572

I last visited my GP exactly a month ago when she started me on these antidepressants, I asked if I can be referred again for an assessment. I was referred to SPA and then they contacted me and over the telephone asked me what’s going on (I told them everything) but at the time I was good (manic) so she was like ok that’s good let’s leave you on the medication for now. I don’t know if that’s what my GP referred me to or if I should be waiting on another referral? I’m just so confused and sick and tired of all these moods. I can’t be productive or do anything when I’m like this. I’m just feeling so down and depressed, I have no idea where my time even goes. I’ll be going back to my GP next week but what should I say?

243;bipolarreddit;BurningEcclectic;31/03/2018;"Trying to get diagnosed... Also looking for health insurance Hi,

I recently have started on the journey to get some help. And new to this sub. I've been reading but to scared to put myself out there.

I don't know if I'm bipolar. I've done a bunch of research and I believe I can trace manic highs and depressed lows as far back as very in early in life... I'm 28 now. The last 4 full ""swings"" as I call them took about 4 and a half to 5 years to run their course. They gotten more pronounced as I started adulthood. This last one landed me a 3 month mania build up with full blown mania for about a month (I wish I could explain this part better... All I can say is that I was not myself and I was pretty delusional about what I could and couldn't accomplish... Sleeping three or four hours every day or two and trying to do everything) and then one of the hardest depressions I've ever experienced for roughly four or five months (suicidal thoughts, complete isolation from everyone and everything including work, weight gain of about 70 pounds, increased self loathing).

I'm also a complete fuck up in life. So maybe that's a consideration. This last time, the catalyst for my swing was believing I could do a new job, and then eventually hiding from it because I couldn't carry some of the tasks out due to anxiety.

I guess I wanted to give out some info since I see a lot of you guys share yourselves openly... And maybe vent, too.

So two days ago was tough. And I've been thinking and thinking about trying to get help, but the farthest I've gotten is two therapy sessions with someone I really didn't hit it off with. 

So after having a shitty wave of self hatred that day, I decided to call around again. I found a practice with a therapist and psychiatrist. I went through the process of setting up an appointment to first see the therapist and then the psychiatrist.

I don't have health insurance. 

It's a steep bill, but I can pay it. 

As a side note, before I tried the new job, I landed myself a decent paying job that is also self employed so I can take days or even weeks off without too many reprocussions. I've done that going on 6 years. It's very difficult to explain but I developed a skill at this job and I could do it the rest of my life if I wanted. But because it is set up the way it is, it doesn't give me health insurance, retirement, or any benefits you might find at other jobs.

I figured if I was going to shell out a wad of cash to self pay for trying to get help (and ongoing therapy if it's recommended), I should look at just self paying for insurance.

I just don't know where to start so I don't get health insurance sales calls. I didn't even know those existed. I was called almost 20 times in 6-8 hours. Fuck maybe more. And I was trying to work.

I don't want to risk ANOTHER set of health insurance salespeople having my information. I just found my state's marketplace? Seems more legit than the 2nd AD on Google.

Does anyone have experience or a better starting place? I asked a family member but no one is in this particular situation. And I don't even understand how health insurance works really.

I'm in my kinda of even place in the episodes. Truth be told, if I hadn't had an exceptionally hard day two days ago and talk to someone about it briefly I probably wouldn't be asking for help. I never really ask for help. But I feel the shit building up against my demons again and I'm so afraid of another swing.

I just want of this train. I need a change.";2748;93;558;55;51;905;302;697

245;bipolarreddit;burntupquestions;05/01/2018;"Wondering If I’m Bipolar... So, for as long as I can remember, I’ve had issues with mental health. It didn’t get bad until around 12, when I started self-harming, and eventually I was hospitalized at 14 after a suicide attempt. There, I was put on Zoloft for depression and also diagnosed with anxiety. For a few months, I felt happy so I figured it was working. I stopped cutting, I felt good. Eventually, I just stopped taking it without a doctor’s consent, but I took myself off of it slowly. I started cutting again after that. 

That’s my only experience with doctors/psychologists since and I’m 19, turning 20 in 5 months. 

I had my first hallucination when I was 16, but the timeline is so bad and foggy because my brain literally can’t remember anything besides the event itself - I was in the shower and just like flicking a switch, I thought somebody was in the bathroom with me, trying to “get” me. Immediately, I opened the curtains to find nothing but still wasn’t convinced. I went to my room, thinking something was following me from behind the entire time and closed my door, psychotically looking around for whatever was there trying to get me. For about 3 hours, I sat in the corner of my room, looking back and forth between things that would just escape my direct line of sight - it was like I could only see the “things” trying to get me in the corner of my eye. I wouldn’t move off my bed in fear that it was under my bed, and would snatch me that way. It felt so real at the time. I forgot it even happened the next day and didn’t remember it until months later, when it randomly popped into my mind, but I couldn’t place it along a coherent timeline - only that it had happened sometime that same year. 

A few months after I remembered the event, I was in class and out of nowhere (just like last time) I thought somebody (who, in my head, looked similar to the girl from the ring/exorcist) was inside the room with me. I started darting my eyes everywhere making sure that she wasn’t - it felt real but apart of me knew it wasn’t but that didn’t help it go away. All throughout the day I continued feeling like she was right behind a closed door, or peaking out at me from somewhere. On the bus ride home, I was convinced she was somehow following me, in vans, in cars, buildings - this thing that was following me didn’t adhere to the normal rules of transportation, she could transport between buildings just to keep an eye on me. It happened about three or four times, varying on levels of intensity for about two weeks and that was the last time I’ve had delusions or hallucinations (if that’s even what they are). 

Now fast forward to 2017, where after smoking weed one night I get put into this semi-catatonic state where I felt unreal, like a joke and like where I lived and the people around me were fake too. All kinds of memories of my childhood were playing on fast-forward on my head, except I was outside looking at my younger self and it was terrifying, I was convinced that I was actually going to die. Now, this experience is drug-induced but after this first time, I began having experiences like this without being high and the thoughts couldn’t leave my mind - I felt unreal, fake all the time, and occasionally I wouldn’t be able to view the world around me as real, or the people. This happened between July 2017 - December 2017, and it’s just starting to subside after I quit weed a few days ago. But, while it was happening, it left me in a severe depression. 

Now, since the new year, I have been energetic and positive - I feel better about my body (which, all throughout my life I have struggled with) and have positive thoughts about it. And not just “I love my body!” its more like “I can 100% fix my body and make it how I want it!” I didn’t sleep for 40 hours straight albeit a 2.5 hour nap before my shift. During work, I was talkative (which I NEVER am) and had something to say to about 99% of the customers. It was almost as if when the thought popped in my head, no matter what it was, I had to say it. Nothing inappropriate, mostly just about the products or casual talk or responses but it was so natural. My answers are NEVER natural because I have social anxiety - I’m always rethinking it before I say it. But not this time. I bagged their groceries so fast, I couldn’t stop singing songs in my head, occasionally singing them out-loud in front of customers and not feeling embarrassed (like casual singing when you have a song stuck in your head, except it was a few different songs) When I wasn’t with a customer, I couldn’t not be moving, my hands, my legs etc.

Once I got home, I became obsessed with watching and rewatching and tweeting about my favorite show. I had so many thoughts about the show and my favorite characters that I just had to put them out there. I think I tweeted about 500-600 times within 6 hours. On top of that, I was also writing some characters for a TV show I’m writing and usually I’m a little stunted w/ writing because I’m usually depressed but it was like I could write for ages. I wrote like 10 characters within an hour. 

This has been going on since the New Year, and I’ve gotten a total of... less than 20 hours of sleep within 5 days. And now I just got the idea that I want to finally get my license so I can get a car and runaway. I know, logically, the plan seems bad but it’s like I have no intention of doing anything else? Like all of my effort is going into that plan. 

And lastly, on top of all this, I haven’t eaten one meal since the new year and I don’t feel hungry at all. No desire to eat really, albeit a few snacks here and there. 

I’ve had past experiences with being energetic, so I always speculated whether I was bipolar but never like this. 90% of the time, I have been depressed

So, sorry this was long but please, how do I know if this is really bipolar? Since these symptoms started, I’ve also become obsessed with researching hypomania/mania and the thought will not leave my brain. So am I just making the symptoms up or am I actually bipolar?????";4756;182;910;74;75;1550;426;1177

I also have OCD which has given me the biggest flare ups in past years. I wouldn't say I've necessarily been ""happy"" the past few years but I've been mostly okay, and my biggest struggles have been with my OCD.

However, over the past few weeks I've start slipping deeper and deeper into depression. My last major depressive episode came in 2015 after the manic period that led me to being properly diagnosed with BP1. It all feels like it came on very suddenly and intensely and I'm having a really difficult time managing it. Right now I'm high functioning but just barely. I can make it into work (normally somewhat late but I make it there), I can force myself to shower most days, make myself eat, I take my meds, etc. Sleep has been a problem. I fall asleep (thanks to seroquel) but I find myself waking up throughout the night, often from a night terror. I know from the past that this high-functioning state can quickly devolve for me and leave me unable to do anything until the depression passes. 

I met with my psychiatrist last week and discussed the depression and have added on 150 mg Wellbutrin in addition to the Lamitcal, Abilify, and Seroquel that I take. I logically know that once the Wellbutrin begins to work I should feel at least a little better. It's just so painful right now- I'm back in the place I've been before where I feel empty and unable to enjoy even the things I love. 

I guess all of this is to say that I'm looking for some support, advice on how to cope, etc. I have people in my life I can talk to who try and support me and I'm grateful for that but this illness can be so isolating. ";1444;53;260;27;28;468;183;348

263;bipolarreddit;CaptMcnomnom;01/02/2018;"Mania I often see people (on here/other mental health subreddits) expressing happiness when they say they were manic or had a manic episode. 

But I hate it. My mania is the thing that makes me want to get a knife out and slide across my neck. I have no control over myself. I develop tremors and can't stop moving. I want to smash things. Get a hammer and put holes in my walls and through the windshield of my car. I can't even set down to write a whole email. I'll type a few words, then go and walk or spas out, then come back and do it all again. 

I've gotten manic while driving before or felt it come on, and one of the only things that helps at the time is to stick a knife in my leg. Not inside my leg, but just putting the tip on my flesh and putting just enough pressure to focus on the pain instead of mania.

I have an anxiety med that works to help (Klonopin) but taking my max dosage doesn't always help. my max is 4mg, but I've taken up to 20mg before. 

When I'm manic is the time when I cry the most.

But, looking at their Instagram story, I see they met up with two of our mutual friends and went to a place I love and wanted to go to this morning but didn’t have time. I told them this today.  What gives?

I make an effort to make plans but usually, no one wants to do it when it comes time. My partner from out of state was in town and they share the same friends. Only two, a couple, made some time for us during the few days he was here. This also happened before he moved. I’m confused. I stay in my room and do nothing.

So let me start at the beginning of this episode. I lost my mom tragically on Christmas. I was the one that found her and well needless to say there is a lot I don't remember for a couple weeks after. I was able to get the stuff that needed done done with my siblings and I went into a massive depression/anxiety/mania almost to the point of a nervous breakdown.  I shut down completely for a couple days and things have not been the same since then.

I have tried to take each day as it comes and deal with my issues as I always have. I go for a more natural treatment because I couldn't handle the side effects of the meds. But I seem to have hit a mania where I am not sleeping and am not making the best decisions. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this or not or if there is something else wrong with me, but I tend to, in my mania go from timid to housekeeper of the year to gourmet chef to Julia Roberts in pretty woman without getting paid to depressed and feeling worthless. This cycle has gone on for the last month and I'm starting to worry. (My mania does this, but usually doesn't last this long)

Has/does anyone else been able to calm down the mania without the meds or should I just deal with the mental fog, lack of feeling, and general distortion I feel when I take the meds to get back on track to where I was before my tragedy?";1224;38;252;13;16;395;162;316

And some of the more peripheral symptoms are definitely more pronounced and progressive. Every year it seems like I have more trouble with memory, attention, and verbal ability.

296;bipolarreddit;chemkitty123;07/01/2019;"Struggling to stay medicated (xpost from r/bipolar2) I was diagnosed a few years ago (bp2) after a long depressive stage and short hypomania. Basically I have a hard time staying medicated. I recognize that it helps make the depressive and hypomanic stages more manageable and my life more livable in some ways. However, there are a few things counteracting this:

1. I sometimes get this intense urge to cut/hurt myself. It's so intense that I can't focus on anything else, and it makes me very irritable and frustrated. All I can think about is ripping my veins open, I want it more than anything. Theyve tossed around the idea that it could be harm OCD ,but no therapy (ERP) works on it. No idea if it's that or just another facet of bipolar, but it seems to get more intense and unbearable when I'm slightly affected by but not consumed by depression. This plays into wanting to stop medicating because it gets so intense that I'd almost rather be severely depressed. It's like I can't win.

2. In a sick way, I like feeling extreme emotions. I really can't describe it. I don't enjoy being severely depressed or even hypomanic, and yet I want it. Even the depression.

3. I think I deserve it. I'm not sad about deserving it either. Rather, I'm angry about it. Angry about not feeling extreme emotions and instead feeling dead all the time, even though I'm still experiencing rapid cycling with only sometimes less intensity.

Just. I'm fucking mad. All the time. I want to flay my veins and feel all the feelings. And yet I'm sick of it all 

Just, can anyone relate? I don't know how to fix this, or if I even want to feel okay anymore. I'm waiting for a new therapist in February and I'm not hopeful that it will help. Waiting for psychiatrists appt at the end of January, and I dont even know what to say. I'm fucking sick of trying meds and trying to justify side effects...nausea, rashes, 60 pounds gained, lack of focus, constant exhaustion, poor memory.

Now, I want to go back in time and slap that stupid smile off my stupid face. I was never going to make it. I was stupid to think that I could. I have had anorexia nervosa since I was eleven years old. My BMI is around 13. Every time I move my head I can feel my blood pressure doing some weird shit. I've had disordered tendencies since I was six. I do not remember a time when I was at peace with myself. 

I don't think I'll ever get better. I've tried so many times to heal. I'm on meds. I don't want to give up hope. There's a small part of me that wants to keep going. I really do want to be able to do a degree someday, move out of home, maybe even find love. God, I'm so lonely. I have friends, sure. But I want to experience love. It seems like it's useless to pursue that - 90% of relationships involving an individual with bipolar end in divorce. I imagine that this is higher for those with BD1. But I have so much love to give. I was in a relationship until a few weeks ago, but she was emotionally abusive. I can never get better and find love, because my body is disgusting. I'm very short - 5'6"" and female. I'm the shortest in my family by four inches. I'm around 36 kilograms, and I only look normal. I once weight restored to the (still unhealthy for my height) 46kg and I was hideous. I looked overweight. I can never get better from my ED if I ever want anyone to love me. 

I don't know. Just a little rant. I'm tired of trying to get better when it seems like there is no hope for me. Just this past week, I had 7 straight days of eating over 2000 calories. This was a big deal for me. I really thought I could get better. But today I freaked out and ate nothing because I saw how fat I had gotten in only one week. 

I need advice. What do I even do? My new psychiatrist doesn't think I'm sick enough to see me more than once every three weeks. My old one went to jail, but he cared and he saw me once a week. He went under for getting caught cooking morphine, but he was always lovely to me and genuinely cared. This one doesn't really think I'm sick enough to be seen more often. Although, if I ask, I will probably be able to go inpatient in the private hospital she works at. A friend of mine (also BD1) went IP there and found it very helpful, but he's much older than me and I don't know what it was like in his ward as I was down the hall in the eating disorder program. Which I was kicked out of after four days (had panic attack and lit a cigarette in my room).

So. What should I do about treatment? I have the option to go for BD or my anorexia, but I don't do well with other anorexics around as they trigger me. I also have all the group thought experiments/exercises/not sure how to call them from the eating disorder unit, as I got friends who've stayed there to send them to me. In theory I could complete them in my own time if I were to go for BD and stay in that ward instead of the eating disorder ward. However, I do think that some of the things I didn't experience during my time in that ward (takeaway nights, eating in public challenges, etc) may have really helped me. So I'm fairly certain I will go inpatient, but not sure which ward to go to. 

Also, what should I do about my education? Should I just try to get over myself and do a diploma here, then review my options for university (be that domestic or abroad) when that's finished or wait and see what happens with the remark or resit my exams? 

This got long, I'm sorry. I skipped meds yesterday morning and last night. But I just really need some help. I'm so tired.";3391;92;759;42;79;1143;351;923
305;bipolarreddit;ChoiceRegular;06/04/2019;"Just received my BP2 diagnosis - 12 years in the making Hey everyone. Although knowing that I suffer from Bipolar II Disorder is disheartening, it is a relief to have a diagnoses and a concrete action plan to manage it. I have suffered from Major Depression since the age of 9; but it wasn't until this week, at the age of 21, that I was diagnosed with BP2 after having a 2.5-week-long hypomanic episode.

During my episode, I displayed all textbook symptoms to varying degrees of destructiveness. Luckily, I did not do anything that had huge lasting consequences. During these 2.5 weeks, I was aware that I was acting abnormally, but I didn't see any problems with it because I felt better than I ever had before while sleeping less than 2 hours each night and eating less than 500 calories per day. When I crashed out of it, I knew that I had to speak with my psychiatrist.

He immediately took me off of my 300mg Wellbutrin (I haven't noticed any withdrawal symptoms yet) and scheduled an appointment with me ASAP. At the appointment, we discussed the many options for medication (anti-psychotics &amp; mood stabilizers). We settled on Depakote and I am now on 500mg for 14 days, then 1000mg for the next 14. At that point, we will meet again and re-evaluate the treatment plan.

It seems like this is a very informative and supportive community. If you all have any advice or resources to offer someone who is starting out on their treatment journey, I'd be happy to hear it. I am especially interested in people's experiences with Depakote, apps that can be used to track mood, and how to build up a support network of friends and family.

However, maybe the impression is justified in the sense that almost all people with bipolar bring unnecessary drama to mentally healthy people? 

When I was unmedicated, I know the mania caused trouble. And even medicated I still have some issues and understand that medication only lessens the frequency, duration, and severity of episodes and does not fully stop it.

310;bipolarreddit;cinemagical414;05/04/2019;"Recent experience with lamictal &amp; painkillers Hello friends.

I've been on lamictal for about 8 months. It was a godsend to me. Starting from a very low dose, it helped me feel more content and at-ease, and I went from having panic attacks every time I left the house to being able to go about and live my life.

Here's the wrinkle: I initially spiraled into crippling depression and anxiety last year after tapering off of the opiate pain medication oxycodone. I was on on oxycodone after undergoing a surgical procedure to stabilize much of my cervical spine, which had become unstable as a result of a genetic condition I have. I was in a horrible place, and Lamictal is what finally got me out of it.

I was about 9 months post-op last year and doing really well, feeling really great about my health and future, when a bunch of my pre-operative symptoms suddenly returned. Scans confirmed that my surgery had failed, and I had to go through a revision procedure -- a more complex procedure than I had before -- earlier this year. Currently, I am a bit more than 2 months post-op from the revision surgery. I was hoping to keep my pain meds low and get off of them quickly this time around, but the surgery was predictably much more painful, and I also developed an infection shortly after surgery that sent my pain levels sky-high -- unlike anything I had experienced before. So while I wanted to limit my use of oxycodone, I ended up on double the dose I took last year (60 mg total per day, vs. 30 mg total per day last year).

I have spent the last month carefully tapering off of oxycodone. I am now down to 25% of what I was initially taking after surgery (i.e., I'm now down to 15 mg total per day), which is 50% of what I was taking last year. Everything seemed to be going smoothly, which I attributed in part to being on lamictal this time. Then about a week ago, just before the step-down to my current oxycodone dose, I started to feel the depression creep back in. Hoping to get ahead of it, I called my p-doc and we decided to increase my dose of lamictal a bit, from 125 mg to 150 mg. But instead of protecting me from decline, I feel like the increased dose accelerated the onset of symptoms. I am significantly more depressed and irritable, and I have started to become anxious and a bit agoraphobic again. Making matters much worse, some physical symptoms have flared up this week, including a very alarming sharp pain right at the base of where my surgery was performed. While these symptoms may be a normal part of the long healing process after a major surgical procedure, I am terrified that something got screwed up again. I took a little extra oxycodone this morning and it has helped the pain somewhat, but this is obviously not the direction I want to go in for the sake of my mental health.

I guess I'm posting here because I feel frightened and a bit trapped. Last year, lamictal was like a miracle for me. I felt relief at a very low dose, and I continued to experience improvement as I increased the dose. I was hoping for the same result when I increased the dose last week, but I am only feeling more depressed and anxious. That said, there are a ton of other factors in play here, including my oxycodone taper, continued recovery from surgery 2 months ago, a flare-up of physical symptoms, fear about the state of my surgery and recovery, normal psychological distress resulting from my current ordeal (feeling isolated/cooped up, losing autonomy, feeling uncertain about my future, etc.), fear of the fear I experienced last year when things went south, etc. etc.

Typing this out, it seems unreasonable to expect anything from a small increase in my lamictal dose one way or the other -- or at the very least, it seems impossible to parse out what is a result of lamictal versus the many other things going on. But I guess I'll still throw my inquires out there:

1. Has anyone experienced a marked increase in depression or anxiety upon increasing their lamictal dose, and if so, did things even out with time or further dosage increases?
2. Does anyone have experience with oxycodone / other opiate painkillers that impacted your mental health or interacted with your psych meds?

For what it's worth, I also take Effexor XR 75 mg daily, Dexedrine SR 5 mg 2x/day, and Klonopin 0.5 mg at night to sleep.";3443;162;582;83;35;1117;330;797

Anyhow, going through a mental health transition. Seeking help I’ve felt that I needed for a long time now. I could only repress myself for so long. This last melt down, completely broke me. My life that I created is, in my eyes, perfect. I’ve worked so hard to have it all, to not be my mom. And yet here I am, in the shower, tears blending with the water and my dog is scratching at the door to get in. But in that moment, I wanted everything to stop. Even my heart. 
I pulled myself out of the shower. Looked in the mirror. Wiped my eyes and smiled. I couldn’t convince myself I was ok, but maybe I could to my husband. Got dressed, went downstairs. Tried folding some laundry. Tried hiding. Tried holding back. But I looked at him and completely lost it. 
-
Immediately, I made an appointment with my primary that week. From there, I have now sought out a therapist and psychiatrist. I’ve since tried new medications. Not to much help. 
How am I supposed to feel? Bipolar 2 is my official diagnosis. However, I always mask and mask and mask and pretend. I’m very high functioning.

So I've seen this guy on three separate occasions and the first time we met, he seemed very serious about only meeting with me if I stayed compliant with my medication. Honestly, I have a problem with doing so because I've been a bit self-destructive and purposely go off of medication to ""feel"" something or to induce mania.

Well, after having a particularly bad depressive episode after a particularly bad manic episode that started to become psychotic (seeing shadow people, forming complex delusions, thinking my assailant is after me again), I'm struggling to figure out how I'm going to talk to him about dumping my seroquel down the toilet.

Truth be told, like I've read many others say, seroquel makes me feel dead. It helps regulate sleep, but I hardly function in the day and it does a damn good job of making me in a continual depressive state. I told him when he tried to re-prescribe it to me the first time I met him after being out of the psychiatric hospital ... and he didn't listen to me or take me seriously when I told him it makes me suicidal. :c

So now that I broke my promise of not taking my seroquel, idk how to communicate to him that I don't trust him. He didn't even refill my lithium after we first met, so I was rapid cycling all of February. I feel like an emotional train wreck and the seroquel helped me crash from my manic episode last week, but this depressive episode this week was god awful.

Should I just find a new psychiatrist if I don't feel like he is helping me and I don't trust him? Being on Medicaid makes my life more difficult. If it helps, I have type I with psychotic features and PTSD.

Today I had my second visit with the new pdoc. I got a really good vibe from her during our first meeting last month. She spent over an hour with me and really listened and then presented a measured plan of changing up meds.

I think the new meds are working as I feel more like myself lately than I have in a long time. I saw the pdoc again today and my good vibes were confirmed. I think she can really help me. I brought in a print out from the mood tracker app I have been using (which I learned about from you guys) and she praised me for being a ""perfect patient,"" lol.

Just last year, while in jail actually, after coming down from a manic episode and then spiraling further into the latter, I was finally confronted again with my type 1 bipolar diagnosis. I was lit back on my meds, (depakote ER, trazadone, gabapentin and prasosin) and stayed on them until being transferred to a rehab facility (as a result of trauma, undiagnosed/misdiagnosed bipolar I developed a really shitty and extreme addiction issues) where they were ""hostilic"" and took me off my meds. One manic episode in and they made a exception for that rule quickly....lol. after that, and making a ""timeline"" of my relapses, and it being made clear as day that taking my meds, for me, is a matter of life and death because of my addiction, I stayed on them, and stable for a few months. I had a slip where I stopped taking my meds, went manic after a week, relapsed, but was able to catch myself before everything went to shit...but again a few months later the same thing happened, I wasn't so lucky, and have been stuck in another relapse for a few months and self medicating.
I now find myself very aware I need my meds. J talked to my therapist today who essentially told me that I need to accept my diagnosis, and that I need to take my meds if I want to succeed, based on all the past times I've tried anything otherwise. I've had intentions of calling my psych doctor, I plan to, but I'll pick up the phone and put it down. Or procrastinate it. When manic I'll say that it will keep me from fulfilling my purpose or ""take away"" my ability to ""feel fully"" and ""see the future"". I KNOW I need to. I plan on calling first thing tomorrow for the first possible appointment. I want to get better. But I won't stop fucking myself over.

340;bipolarreddit;confessi0ns;01/02/2018;"WarningIs this a Manic Episode? [Please HELP] [x-post /r/bipolar] I've been diagnosed with bipolar by three different psychiatrists. I kept asking for different opinions because I thought I was ""simply"" afflicted with major depression (on and off, for about a decade!).

I've finally accepted the diagnosis and started the treatment, but the pills that the doctor prescribed are exclusively to treat symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar disease (Lamictal). 

For the past 5 days, however, I've been experiencing something **very** different:

* Some of my thoughts seem foreign to me, in the sense that I **know** they don't make sense, but I am still drawn to/consumed by them.

* I do and say things that are completely outrageous. Even though I am perfectly aware that they are outrageous, I somehow can't stop myself.

* It's very easy to trigger my irritability. I am screaming loudly and aggressively, and using profanity at the slightest of provocations.

* I am vicariously living some fantasies. When I say vicariously, I mean that I am having extreme reactions of nostalgia over things that never happened (fake memories). It's strange in the sense that I **know** they are fake but, at the same time, I believe them?

My head is a big mess. I don't have any answers. When I'm depressed, none of this happens. 

Right now, I feel like I have more than one person inside my head. There is the rational side, the side that is aware that something is off, the side that is writing this. And then there is the unbalanced side, the side that is causing all this havoc.

The only thing that seems to help is to go clubbing, or to a place with a lot of noise. It somehow makes my thoughts more clear and leaves me more relaxed (even without the help of alcohol).

Has anyone experienced any of these things? I am scared, but I end up driving away everyone that tries to offer their help. ";1484;72;256;33;43;469;181;339

I’ve officially made it past the one year mark of my major manic episode post diagnosis. 2018 was really hard as I was in a depressive episode and had to work through medication and side effects for the first six months. 

I started a new job in September and started taking improv classes in May. Things are finally at a relatively calm place—for the first time since my husband and I got married in 20-5, it looks like we might have a nice quiet year without any major life changes (that happened to me in prediagnosis manic episodes)

We know that stability is never guaranteed. My goal this year is to do everything in my power to stay stable, and be able to steer through an episode if/when one comes up. So, what does stable mean to me?

S: Sleep. 8-10 hours, one hour without electronics, in bed by 10:30, out of bed by 7:30 
T: Therapy. Going to personal and couples therapy, meditation, journaling, being kind to myself through self talk. 
A: Activity. Working out consistently, more walking and biking as transport, being outside more
B: Balance. Work vs life, alone vs social, self care vs being productive, comfort vs growth
L: Learning- less tv, more books and hobbies. More improv!
E: Eat healthy, drink water, take meds and vitamins

I have been terrified of changing anything because it almost always leads to suicidal urges and self harm. When my previous psychiatrist changed me from risperdal to geodon  I had a manic episode that lasted several months. I ended up in the hospital, 5150, suicide attempt, lots of cutting. When she put me on serroquel, I had such bad vertigo and extreme sedation that I stumbled into a wall and broke my nose.

I changed to a new psychiatrist about 3 months ago. She wanted to to start reducing my meds. I was willing to try because of the effing side effects and also the fact that the meds don't begin to control my symptoms.

We lowered lamictal waaaay too fast, long story. I was off it for about 2 weeks after taking 400mg a day for many years. I just went nuts when it was all out of my system. I felt suicidal urges that seemed uncontrollable and like I might try, though it was against my will. I cut myself up. My dearest husband has worked from home for the last 3 weeks, keeping me safe.

I have some trauma from my childhood because of his manic episodes in which he became violent. I can remember at least 3 episodes where he had psychosis. My parents divorced but lived together on and off for years. Apparently my dad's doctor released him and said he was ""cured"" and didn't need any more treatment 10 years ago or so my mom tells me.

Well fast forward to this past Thursday my dad had an episode of psychosis following days of mania and there was a lot of alcohol involved. He apparently hallucinated that my mom was screaming at him and being horrible to him and he's hospitalized right now. The police found him wandering the streets at 5am. I saw him Friday morning in the emergency room and he was still babbling on and on rocking back and forth and seemed to be scared of something, I think demons possibly from what he was babbling about. 

Well he was given a shot and moved to the crisis center in the local hospital. I visited him today and finally got him to sign a release stating his doctors can talk to me. But he still believes that my mother was screaming at him and doing horrible things to him which are not true.

I let him tell me all of this and my mom was there visiting too. I didn't say much because I needed him to trust me. He thinks there is nothing wrong with him and claims the doctors told him that he is fine and not bipolar at all and they've given him pills to calm him down. My mom said he can't come home and she wants nothing to do with him ever again and all of his care is in my hands now.

Mostly I'm just venting here. I want to tell him he was hallucinating but he still isn't well so I'm guessing that's not a great idea. I feel he will come around and realize he was hallucinating but I don't know how bipolar works. I don't know what's going to happen to him now. ";1519;59;311;21;30;493;191;387

364;bipolarreddit;CroissantCroissalt;28/01/2019;"Content with the idea of suicide. Here's why Content with the decision?

Hi everyone,

First time poster and visitor. And suicidal. But not in a sad, angry sort of way. Let me explain. 

I have a myriad of uncomfortable, growing, and lifelong genetic disorders that aren't obviously visible. I have lumps everywhere that may be cancerous, and I'm currently in the process of finding out. I also have type 2 bipolar disorder. My teeth, lips, mouth, tonsil, and throat structures are all shades of fucked, meaning I'll need multiple surgeries, braces, and apnea machines in my future. My family has a history of a few kinds of cancer, heart problems, liver problems, balding, and Alzheimer's. I'm freshly in my twenties, so thinking about how ugly this can get for me is seriously worrying and a complete drain on any vision I have of the future. 

But that's not really the primary reason I want to leave this world. I just feel complete, finished, done. Not in a depressive way (at least, not all the time), but in a closure / final chapter sort of way. 

I have felt nothing but love from family and friends, have had many successful relationships, have had a super privileged life, and have set myself up for a decent future after Uni. However, I just don't care. I'm content with the time I have spent here and would rather burn out than fade away. My medical issues will surely put myself and my family into debt. My studies feel worthless even though I am excelling - and they have always felt that way. I never thought I'd make it past 18, and have no real vision of myself past 21.

Every day feels like unnecessary time to be spending. I feel like I should close my book and leave while I am content with my life up to now. 

Have any of you felt this way? Any suggestions or comments? ";1403;61;244;31;25;458;191;333

I am diagnosed BP1 (mixed episodes, rapid cycling), PTSD and ADHD. The meds I took only made things worse so I stopped. I've been fighting symptoms unmedicated due to subconscious fear and denial.

I had a psychotic episode last week that lasted a few days. At one point I recognized my delusions for what they were but the feelings didn't leave. I even had the presence of mind mind to mention inpatient. But I was too scared. So instead of taking it out on my husband verbally, I internalized. I have so much self loathing that I felt I deserved to be hurt. To die. I didn't deserve my family. But I couldn't abandon them either. I love them and they should have so much better than me. 

In the past month or two I stopped taking care of myself. I feel so stressed. I force myself to eat once every other day. I haven't been showering or grooming in a while. Fighting addiction. Not sleeping. Car keeps breaking and I can't keep up with bills. I hate myself but want to change. Would you go to the new appointments or consider inpatient at this point? I have gotten a new job and I desperately want to excel there. What should I tell them?

370;bipolarreddit;ctilley83;01/04/2019;"What careers can BP sufferers succeed in? To start let’s just say I’ve had a very hard time getting my career together.  Took me seven years to get a bachelors degree in Information Systems.  My grades in subjects that interest me I excelled in, and anything else I usually failed or received a sympathy D.

My first Job out of college I was happy for about 6 months, then I started struggling. This was well before I was diagnosed and started having intense panic attacks. I was able to hold that job for another year before I was let go right in the middle of the Great Recession.

So I tried to freelance however I struggled.  I would program for hours upon hours until I would crash after a few days.  That led to poor quality work and I was in over my head. It was the perfect example of being overly ambitious and it led to me abusing Xanax to try and reduce the anxiety. I literally forgot two weeks of my life off of one binge.

Luckily I was diagnosed and got on the right medications. I’ve been sober for quite a few years, but I’ve had very little luck becoming financially independent. That’s kind of the cruelest thing about it because my mood has improved, however I’m still spinning my wheels. I’m getting older and feel like I’m running out of time to build any type of meaningful career.

My question is what careers have bipolar sufferers been able to excel in? Is there anything that fits the personality type so to speak? Seriously need to know what careers would accept someone who is only productive 6 months out of the year and burns out quickly.

I managed to become more successful without them than I have managed to maintain with them.
At what point do life experiences and there impact get added into the equation of medacting someone.  That is not a question.

Saw a regular psych who tried different things so I wouldn't get manic and I was hesitant. Had a huge drunken manic episode, was hospitalized again and prescribed Abilify 10 and it helped a lot. That was almost a year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I was doing okay, taking sleeping pills at night, stomach meds, ativan, propanolol. I needed birth control for PMDD

Recently Psych took me off sleeping pills and ended propanolol (I get severe anxiety an panic attacks). My Birth Control made my anxiety unbearable one week every month so my med doc switched me to something else and increased my stomach meds (acid reflux/gastritis. 

I started an anti inflammatory diet being tired of this mess and was exercising doing well and happy, which my psych thought was hypomania, although I was still depressed a lot. She wanted me to drop my dosage to 10 mg while remaining on 10mg Abilify. I am terribly med sensitive and many things cause crazy reactions for a long time. That is a big cut for me. 

So basically in one month, new birth control (also sensitive), no sleep meds, less anti anxiety meds, more stomach problems and now a decrease in a med that I had no problem with. I'm two days in and already going crazy, what can I expect?

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, Lots of med changes. On Abilify 10mg, ativan twice a day, Loe Estrin Fe, and Dropping 20 mg Citalopram to 10 and feel a mess.";1392;68;233;30;25;448;184;321

So, I don’t know how to start this, I don’t know If I’m bipolar but that’s what I’m looking to find out. Since late middle school I’ve felt depressive moods/ cut myself for 3years, started partying doing drugs and drinking at a really young age and got pretty promiscuous. I never thought I was depressed because sometimes I’d feel really happy and I was capable of that. I thought I was schizophrenic because sometimes I feel delusional or lately I’ve started kind of seeing things or just being extremely terrified of seeing things. I even started to hear my dog choke the other day and when I yelled about it to my sister she said she heard nothing. I just learned that people who are bipolar have delusions and hallucinations, so that part makes sense. I don’t do drugs or cut myself anymore and after those things I tried really hard to clean up my act and managed to do very good in school and still am, but I have absolutely no motivation and I get distracted SO EASILY like not even adderall will help me (again I thought I had adhd but found out this is also a symptom of being bipolar). My mom will sometimes call me “squirrel” because I’ll talk so fast and leap from topic to topic, but other times I can’t even talk to anyone because I get so irritated. I also have weird sleep patterns, I can’t go to bed even when I’m tired and I feel the need to sleep for an incredibly long time most of the time. I also just hate myself, I hate how I look so much, despite constantly being praised for what I look like and whT I achieve. I don’t know if I’m just being paranoid or If I have general anxiety disorder or if I’m bipolar... I’m scared to reach out snd get help, I don’t know how. I get so hysterical and I cry so easily and I am so incredibly anxious. My family doctor is an asshole and my family would completely destroy me if they found out I was getting therapy (when they were alerted by my teacher who found out I was cutting myself my mom was sad for about a minute) and to this day 5-6yrs since they found out my dad will stay make fun of me for being “depressed” about “nothing” and cutting myself. None of them understand mental illness or why anyone with privilege would be mentally ill (because they grew up in communist poland and had to escape and they were “fine”) so I just feel stuck but I hate feeling like this I dont know what to do. 

Tldr; i feel like i could be bipolar but i’m unsure, I don’t know what to do or how to get help. Family would kill me if they knew. ";1984;74;393;34;41;662;218;506

Paranoia, anxiety, extreme memory loss to the point I couldn't recognize wife or children. Ended up in locked room as the paranoid me became the angry me. I knew something was wrongs, I literally felt short circuited, and lashed out at staff, doctors and family. My first, and really only memory of this time, was ripping plumbing off the sink as I prepared to combat staff? as I wanted the hell out of the nightmare I was living. As crazy as it sounds that was a beginning of my recovery. Today I'm stable but have lost big chunks of memories. Events one normally would never forget. Getting married, birth of children, pa#ing of family members much less the little events of life that connect so much of who we are. I thank God I had an advocate in my wife that was able to say enough. The docs kept saying just one more, just one more. Today I'm stable and my BP is under control through meds. Don't take this treatment lightly. It can have ramifications far and long that aren't always positive. Best of luck, T.

407;bipolarreddit;desperatedark;30/03/2019;"Cognitive-Behavioral Function/Dysfunction vs. Mood Disorder I have never felt that my bipolar is a “mood disorder”.  My upbringing and career have made me into someone who is not very in touch with my emotions and moods... I have always been turned off by my pdoc’s suggestion to keep a “mood journal”.

I’ve always seen my moods or moments of happiness/sadness etc as situational.  It is difficult for me to look back at periods of my life and discern any mood swings in the context of bipolar.

Recently, my therapist (a new therapist for me) posed a question: “Are you feeling X or Y? ... those are common in mood disorders...”

My response was to reject the term “mood disorder” as a descriptor for my bipolar.  I said that my experience of bipolar is one of different phases of cognitive-behavioral function or dysfunction. Depression isn’t depressed mood but a decrease in the quality of my functioning (but I can still function if I push myself). Baseline is functioning. The hypomania spectrum is higher functioning (I’ve developed a way to focus hypomania on school/work so I don’t spin out). Mania is complete inability to function [within the confines of societal norms].

And while mania includes a euphoria feedback loop, I see it more than a sub-symptom of delusions- a “mood” that is solely born out of the far-between, brief psychotic states rather than an everyday experience of the majority of my life with bipolar.

And I understand depression and hypomania encompass behaviors and functional levels that are not necessarily strictly associated with moods/emotions, but when it comes to actual moods and emotions, I feel like that is something outside of my bipolar experience. I can stay in bed until noon but still have a great day (or whether I have a good/bad day is dependent on whatever people/stimuli I come across). I can be hypomanic over a work project but then go home at night and get sad due to loneliness. All kinds of combinations of emotionally-neutral activity with situationally-based emotion on any given day.

Anybody else experience bipolar this way? Accepting the bipolar diagnosis but don’t see it as a mood disorder or don’t identify your experience as a “mood disorder”?";1769;105;265;63;28;598;202;388

409;bipolarreddit;Detrimentation;13/01/2018;"The fog has lifted, but I can't tell if it's stability or hypomania After my meds stopped working about a month ago I returned to another awful mixed episode. It was my first period of stability since I first had symptoms two years ago, and I've been so afraid of how long before it would come back. How long I would be useless and unable to function in mixed state hell. I had some med changes last week, but I thought I would never be stable again. 

But this afternoon something changed. It's like my eyes opened wider, my senses were heightened, my energy levels quadrupled, and I now desire to do things. I finally took that shower I couldn't take all week. I was joking around with my family all day and having deep laughs that actually hurt. It felt oh so genuine, too. 

It's not all better, my paranoia's still there, and I was a bit delusional today. Feel a little antsy. My flashbacks of my mania have continued at about the same intensity, as well. 

The thing is the first time I was stable it felt a lot more subtle and not as sudden. It was great since it was the first time I had felt like a person in so long, but this is something else. I feel so disconnected to how I felt just yesterday, it's like it never happened. Like I've been feeling this good forever, and I just woke up from a bad dream. 

The recent med change was increasing my lithium from 900mg@0.6 level to 1200mg@0.9 level. When I was first put on Lithium at only 300mg I had the same high I'm experiencing now, is that typical? Also added on 50mg seroquel, but can a dose that low really do anything yet? 

It might seem overwhelmingly obvious that I'm hypomanic right now, but idk. For one I haven't been hypomanic in so long, recently it's either been manic or mixed manic. Also I feel more in control compared to when I was last hypomanic. More self-aware and hopefully less annoying. Then again maybe that's because I have more experience with this hell now. 

Idk, I really want to just savor how good I feel but I'm kinda worried

 I'm in my last year of college and I have to write a dissertation. The last 2 months however I've spent oversleeping, playing videogames and watching TV. I literally have one thing to do and I can't bring myself to do it. I'm throwing away my future for some quick fixes.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Not sticking to my word

 I've gained some weight (this could also be because of the zyprexa), it's not too bad but it's definitely noticeable. Last week I measured my weight and noticed I'm 8 kilos above my goal weight. So naturally I told myself to stop eating junk food. Well yesterday when I got the chance to order some fried food I instantly went for it. Instead of resisting.

yesterday I went out to have some drinks for the birthday of a friend. The day before I already had too much beers so I said I wasn't gonna drink alcohol. I started the night of with a soft drink but the moment my friend said let's have a beer I instantly caved...

I've been on 250mg lamotrigine for about 6 years now. It works fantastically. However, during the same period I've slowly developed a kind of background inflammation that's basically the same as very minor flu. It's there almost all the time - some days better than others - and is sometimes accompanied by muscle aches/sprains and a slightly sore throat. I also feel like I'm extra warm to the touch.

No doubt the timing is purely coincidental and I have some other problem, but I figured it was worth researching. Unfortunately, however, I can't find much about long-term usage and the only articles that refer to those symptoms are acute allergic responses.

Do any of you have views/experiences here? Naturally I'll pursue it with my doctor too.

Thank you!";732;30;113;21;13;244;116;160

435;bipolarreddit;DoomCityRider;18/01/2019;"PSA: Steroids And Worsening Of Bipolar Symptoms Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, so please always consult with yours when you seek medical treatment.

I don't see this talked about enough. It's flu season and many of us may become sick and be prescribed steroids. 

Steroids have the chance of worsening bipolar symptoms and may send you into a mixed episode or manic episode or worse. 

If you are prescribed steroids, please mention your bipolar diagnosis with your doctor. 

I'm sure there are cases of bipolar people that have taken steroids and have come out fine afterwards. I'm sure there are cases where a bipolar person is required to take steroids as there are infinite personally specific medical conditions and situations. But ask yourself these questions: Have you disclosed your bipolar disorder to the practitioners prescribing steroids? Are you stable? Are you medicated? Do you have the resources to get emergency help should things go wrong? 

I was sick last year and prednisone almost made me kill myself. I had no idea that steroids could make my bipolar disorder worse. I spent over a week in hell as it left my system. Apparently, it even awakens bipolar disorder in otherwise stable bipolars. If anyone has any evidence to the contrary or input or experience, please post.

Mom and sister have asked what makes me bipolar.  I hide basically everything because nothing good has really came out from opening up.  Planning on talking to my sister about it as I trust her more.  I beat around the bush (“uhhh...  Bipolar symptoms...”).  I think they just want to know what’s wrong, but I’m anything but comfortable talking about it, especially with more than one person.

And then there’s my dad!

I accidentally told him because I said something about my antidepressants while I was on a high.  He asked who told me and I told him a psychiatrist.  Didn’t go too much farther.  Whatever, cool.  I asked him a bunch if he was upset because he didn’t look very happy, he said he wasn’t.

Two days ago he said something like “I’ve never seen you have a mood swing.”  Took me off guard, really irritated me.  You don’t need to see me have a mood swing for me to have them.  You don’t need to see me hitting my legs and crying because I feel I’m awful and no one loves me for me to have an actual problem.  He’s seen my self harm before, do you think that magically goes away?  Oh I act fine, but that doesn’t mean I am.  And he has definitely seen me in my highs.  When it’s night and all I do is talk and talk more than normal?  Bipolar isn’t necessarily severe mood swings and acting off of them anyways.

Then last night he decided to turn it up a notch.  I said something that must have riled him up.  His response was that I was “making [him] tripolar.”

What the fuck???

I told him that’s not how it works and it’s not in the DSM and hid in my room.

Seriously.  What the fuck?  Do you not even care how your daughter feels?  Do you not even care bipolar is characterized in part with depression that was *obvious* when I was 12-15 and you did *nothing*?  Even when I had cuts all over my damn arm?  Do you not care that I was in enough pain to go to a psychiatrist?  That I have low self esteem that you say upsets you, but if I do anything about it suddenly my issues don’t exist?  Do you even think bipolar exists?

Thanks Dad.

I’m thankful I’m able bodied.  I’m thankful for my medication.  I may have 20 more years before I could possibly get MS.  I might never get it, but I’m more likely than the average person.

But I’m still able bodied now.  I can enjoy walking places.  I can enjoy climbing and going up stairs upon stairs.  I can enjoy the sand and water on my feet.  I can enjoy having to stand all day.

I might not be able to for my entire life, but knowing that allows me to enjoy my legs, my brain, and my life right now.  A lot of people don’t get that until they suddenly don’t have a limb, or they’re old and their body becomes increasingly more frail.

439;bipolarreddit;dos4g;28/01/2018;"Acceptance...for now. I've been on disability for a good while now. Anyone on disability can probably relate to the strong desire to be away from it. The Social Security office generally treats you like a criminal, you never know who agrees with the negative stigma and sees you as some sort of lazy leach on society, and some days, you fight with the notion yourself. Many people tie worth to one's ability to work and contribute, and it's easy to fall into that realm of thought where you feel worthless and ashamed. 

Anyway, to my story. Around June last year, I was put on a game-changing medication. My anxiety disappeared seemingly overnight, and I felt more confident and comfortable than I have for most of my life. Gears started turning in my head. I could go out among the people! Maybe I could find some companionship and stop feeling so lonely. Maybe I could earn my keep and feel some pride for a change.

This lead to me starting a second part-time job with the intention of ramping up my hours carefully and slowly, the goal being to eventually be making enough to support myself without the SSDI check, Medicare, etc. I was certain I was on track to being an honest, ""normal"" person. I took on more and more responsibilities. Things were looking good for about 6 months.

Then the medication turned on me, as it seems they all eventually do. Every day, things get worse. While it still keeps the majority of my anxiety at bay, I now have a persistent depression. I've lost interest in many things, including wanting to do a good job at work. I let things slip, do the bare minimum, and count each second until I am able to go home. Increasing hours at a job that I am having less and less of a tolerance for seems like a good way to speed up an inevitable crash and burn. If something doesn't change soon, I will likely have a breakdown and/or wind up in the hospital.

And for what?

Before I started the new med and took the second part-time job, I was doing okay for myself. My first part time job was enough to keep me connected to the outside world, even though the pay might have been considered token at best. I kept myself busy with personal projects. At times I felt lonely, but I had friends. I had trouble with anxiety and depression, but I had time and space to cope. 

In my current situation, I feel like I'm on a speeding train. There are no time-outs when I am feeling terrible. What time I have for my own interests is tainted by dread of the next workday and this consistent, low current of depression. The second part-time job has made the first one, *the one I found rewarding and enjoyable,* feel like an inescapable chore. All I want to do now is go home and hide. All this effort put in to build a ""respectable life"" and dig myself out from under disability, and I feel so much more frightened, fragile, and trapped than before. 

No medication has been effective for me for such a long duration. I was certain it was the one, so I ended up biting off more than I could chew. Now, I'm dependent on a drug that makes me miserable and puts me in a precarious emotional state every day. I stress out and hide from my responsibilities. Every day I feel inadequate and not up to snuff. 

And why? Because I felt guilty for being on disability? Because I was certain that life free off it would be better? That I couldn't have companionship, self-worth, or be among the living if I wasn't earning my keep in traditional terms?

After much thought, *I have made a conscious choice to ""regress.""* Clearly, working full time is not an attainable goal for me right now. I'm cutting my current average of 15 hours per week at my second job to around 7. Between it and my first job, I'm likely looking at around 10 a week, which I think will be manageable. Also, I'm getting off the ""wonder drug"" that keeps my anxiety at bay at the cost of my sanity and happiness. I will regroup, stabilize, and *find some damned peace.*

Being off disability wasn't in the cards this time, and *that's okay.* There's a reason I was put on it in the first place. Maybe I will find an opportunity to be financially independent in the future, maybe not. But I will stop with the self-shaming. I can still have a worthwhile life, whatever the circumstances. 

**TL;DR - I found a wonder drug, thought it would finally get me off disability. It didn't, and that's okay. Life goes on.**

A friend I’ve known for about 3 years sent me some concerning texts and I want to know from others’ experience how to tread lightly here.

I’ve known that whole time they suffered from bipolar and was not medicated. In person and in every interaction, we clicked.  I never thought about their disorder unless they were isolating themselves. In which case, I’d reach out to them with some positive message or offer that we go do something together or share how I had felt a similar way and maybe we can grow together. These times were awesome. 

But recently they sent some texts that were out of character. I asked if they were doing ok (which is often what I do when I notice something wrong) and they took offense. I asked if they had been drinking or smoking and that made it worse. This was all through text. I stopped responding only to say “I understand how you’re feeling” and that’s it. I guess they calmed down but now I’m really nervous.

I have Bipolar Type II and am currently taking 1250mg of Depakote. I'm extremely happy with how well my moods are regulated on this medication; I still have a full emotional range without experiencing devastating highs and lows. However, I also have OCD and GAD, and so my psychiatrist recently prescribed me 10mg of Lexapro. I've only been taking it for around a week, but I'm concerned that it's triggering mania. My mood the last few days has been exactly what it is when I'm entering a manic episode: increased sex drive, irate, distractible, and impulsive. I knew that antidepressant-induced mania was possible, but I thought concurrently taking a mood stabilizer would circumvent that possibility. The fact that it's only been a week encourages me to attribute this to something else, but nothing has happened to trigger anything like this and my moods have been so good as of late. 

It may be worthwhile to note that, while my Depakote blood concentration is in the therapeutic range, it's at the low end. Is it possible that the Lexapro is inducing a manic episode and my blood concentration levels aren't high enough to combat it? Or is a week too short of a time period to induce such a thing and I should just call this a bad week? Has anyone here experienced anything like this?

I'm on a solid cocktail of meds, and I take them regularly. But in the last month I've been having stuff go on that I can't tell if it's a result of bipolar or just stress generally, and it would be really really helpful to know if what I'm experiencing is within the norms of breakthrough symptoms, or if I should consider looking for answers outside of my bipolar. The following things I've been experiencing for about six weeks, increasing over the first couple of weeks and then the level at which I'm experiencing them has kind of evened out....

?	Difficulty concentrating. Sometime it feels like there is a fuzzy border closing in around my vision if I'm trying to focus on something. My brain gets fuzzy and my thoughts feel like they are just entitities taking space in my brain, growing and pushing the limits of what my mind can contain (like my thoughts are swelling my brain....fucking weird. I know.)

?	Often feeling like I want to break into tears for seemingly no reason. Much of the time it is because of aforementioned feeling of fuzziness and there not being room in my mind to think straight.
 
?	Feelings of being completely out of control of my own life, that it is driven by external factors only. 

?	Becoming more and more preoccupied with my self-image, again and while all of my measurements are stagnant, am experiencing the physical feeling of being larger, fattier, and I look significantly different in the mirror. 

?	Headaches along my orbital sockets frequently (every 2-3 days), which almost always provokes fuzz brain. 

?	Significantly diminished desire to do anything at all, including hobbies, taking dog for walks, exercising, chores, errands, sex drive diminished - all coupled with physical feeling of absolute physical exhaustion. 

?	Sporadically becoming really tired, sometimes to point of barely being able to keep my eyes opened. Eyes water and vision becomes blurry when this happens. 

?	Significantly more jaw clenching. 

?	Having more defensive responses which tend to come out snappy, when it's totally unwarranted. (This I can almost definitely attribute to my bipolar, I always get snappy when I have mood shifts.)

Well, I just wanted to say:

LIFE IS FUCKING GRAND.

Yeah, Chris has bipolar.  Yeah, his medications suck.  But he's up again.  He's doing again.  This isn't a sudden thing either, this has been slow and gradual and we wouldn't want it any other way; as if we had it faster that's... bad news.

But... our relationship is better than it's ever been.  I stuck through the worst of things and honestly the worst was only about 1-2 years. (Only.  I know that's a long time but seriously, compared to eternity, it's nothing.)  During that 1-2 years time I basically had lost all hope, and was only driven by my promise and loyalty to my husband.  Promises that were hard to keep because he seemed like such a doppelganger.

We kept adjusting medications.  We lowered stress in our lives.  I took over on all the hard stuff and I give Chris whatever latitude I can.  I've lost my judgementality. Chis still judges himself very strongly and I am trying to help him be less critical.  He's come a long way but he wants to help more and I think this is a good sign.  He just needs to be more patient with himself.

About 4 years ago he had another psychotic break.  This was while he was medicated.  But the problem was we were moving.  The stress of this put him over; it's something that happens.  But the second time was much milder, much easier.  Firstly, everything was set up so we had a p-doc (The best, thank you Madeline, god, thank you so god damned much) and he had medication, and he was able to recognize the discrepancies.  The first time through he had no idea something had gone wrong in his head.  But this time he DID and it made a HUGE difference.  ([Here's where I wrote about it](http://www.pushypixels.com/post/122389851999/missing-the-man-who-is-there) at one point, sorry the picture is missing my hosting screwed up; I'll have to fix that later.)

Anyway, that was much milder and cleared up in a few months.

So, all sounds pretty bad-ish, not GRAND like I claim, but seriously, let's step back and look at things, specifically this statement:

&gt; During that 1-2 years time I basically had lost all hope

I.  
Had.  
Lost.  
All.  
Hope.

I had lost the LOVE OF MY LIFE.  He was gone.  I was resigned to caring for his shell for the rest of my days.  I even... god help me... I even wished for his death.  Or my own.

And NOW I HAVE HIM BACK.

There are no words I can write to explain the magnitude of this.  None.  All the worldly troubles I've ever had have MELTED in the face of this tragedy.  All of them.

Anyway, hope this was worth a little read.  Chris will be waking up soon and I am gonna cuddle him back into bed the moment he does! &lt;3

During the bad times:

* Take it a day at a time
* There's only so much you can do to help.
 * Get them their pills on time.
 * Force a smile, laugh even if you don't think you need to.
 * Be around when you can.
* You also have to help yourself.
 * Focus on work, focus on friends, focus on YOU.
 * Stop worrying every second about your SO, the worries don't help either of you.

I've been diagnosed with bipolar for 6 years. Anxiety and previously depression for 15


I've been having one of the worst depressed episodes in years. We're going on 5 months now. Typically when I have an episode and I'm working the either the collateral damage from the mania or stagnancy from the depression lead to me losing my job.  But with this one I have short term disability insurance and FMLA so my job is protected. 


I'm at home thinking about what I want to do with my life and if the life I lead could be contributing to the stress I feel. I went to high school for writing and was a college drop out for film.  I have a passion for the arts, a talent for the science, and an interest in a lot of other fields.  And surmountable debt from my previous studies.
  

Part of me knows the reasonable thing would be to go back to work, but it feels like a big ol wall is blocking me.


The tricky thing is that the disease makes you feel like moving and making changes and starting new projects and idk if thats what that really is.  I could use some outside insight

times, but symptoms would pass by the time I got an appointment, or
didn't seem serious enough. I had a manic episode in 2015. I was
hospitalized and then later went to an outpatients psychosis response
service. Was put on Olanzapine. Later I was put on fluoxetine. After a
while I came off olanzapine and have only been on fluoxetine
since 2016. I also quit drinking in 2016. All that helped and I have
been sober/stable for over 3 years now.

One thing I've noticed since my psychotic episode is it's been really
hard to make friends. I haven't made any new friends since then, and
I've drifted away from the ones I have. Part of this is just getting
older (I'm 29), but I've noticed when I do meet people I would
potentially care about, I'm just not that invested. I'm also slightly
fatigued the whole time. The fatigue doesn't affect me when I'm cycle
touring, but then we're talking 8+ hours of hard activity a day. I
can't possibly do that every day as a software developer. I cycle
every day commuting for about an hour and a half, so I'm not inactive.

I don't have much ambition any more and it really feels like life is 
passing me by. One of the most noticeable things about this is that 
when I was actively bipolar I would be fixated on people. I was in 
love with someone I'd say continuously for 9 years (not the same 
person). But now I haven't really been attracted to anyone since I was 
treated. Obviously the previous thing wasn't healthy; but nowadays I 
try to date but I just don't develop any attachment to them. I'd say 
it's lack of sex drive, but it's broader than that because I'm also 
like this with potential new platonic friends. It'd be great to have
something in the middle.

I'm not sure how to approach this. I've been thinking it may be the 
change of being sober and treated along with the trauma of having had 
such a serious episode; but alongside that I've been wondering if it's 
something more basic like emotional blunting from fluoxetine, so I'm 
thinking of talking to my doctor; but she's a GP and I don't have a 
dedicated psychiatrist any more. Counselling is really expensive and I 
used to just get it on the NHS. Not sure how to approach looking for 
it myself. A lot of this may not even be a bipolar-specific thing so 
much as like a personal development/life situation thing. 

Has anyone had experience with this kind of problem and how did you 
approach it/what helped?

456;bipolarreddit;DrPotato2301;26/03/2018;"Have been taking Lexapro 10mg for past 4 days. Feeling like my depression is gone since yesterday. Not sure if it's Lexapro or if it might be a hypomanic or a manic phase.(X-post from r/depression) I'm not sure if cross-posting is allowed. Here is the [link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/87a00b/have_been_taking_lexapro_10mg_for_past_4_days/) on r/depression. 

**TL;DR** Not sure what type of depressive disorder(PDD, Smiling Depression, SAD, Cyclothymia or Bipolar 2) I have. My psychiatrist started me Lexapro 10mg and based on how it goes, he said we could try switching to mood support meds. I've been taking Lexapro since Thursday and I've been feeling like my depression is gone since yesterday. I'm worried I might be in a hypomanic or a manic phase(got told by my psychiatrist that Lexapro elevates the mania and asked me not to take it if I'm in a hypomanic or manic phase).


I met my psychiatrist last Thursday and we talked about my depression. I've always had ups and downs in my life for a few years. But I always thought it was because of my actions that caused then and not the other way around. I'm still not sure what type of depressive disorder I have. Since I had like 2 weeks time before my appointment, I did a bit of research reading about the depression types and how each of them is different in their own way. So I told my psychiatrist that I wasn't sure if had the persistent depressive disorder, seasonal affective depression, smiling depression or Cyclothymia(aka bipolar lite).


When I was doing my research and if there was something relatable to me or if something similar has happened to me before, I noted them down as a list. We talked about how I identified that I was depressed and all the points on the list. Then he told me that even he wasn't sure if I had Dysthymia, smiling depression, bipolar 2, or cyclothymia. So as a general procedure, he said that he is going to prescribe me meds to help with depression and if it doesn't work, he is going to prescribe me mood support meds for cyclothymia or bipolar 2. 


He prescribed Lexapro 10mg to take every morning and asked me to get back to him in 2 weeks about how the meds were working. He also warned me not to take Lexapro if I feel like I have a hypomanic or a manic phase as it might elevate the mania. 


I've been taking Lexapro since Thursday and I've been feeling like I'm not depressed since yesterday. I was not sure if it's my hypomanic phase and I didn't take my meds today.


So these were the differences that I noticed in me yesterday compared to the day before:


* I feel fresh, more energetic, and I feel like I got back my motivation to do things. 
* I've been procrastinating to buy my vitamins for a week and I ordered them yesterday (I still have vitamins for the next couple of days) 
* I smoked close to double the number of cigarettes than I did during the past few days
* I was clenching my jaw more than usual and today morning, I had a little pain in my enamel 
* I've been hitting my bed at 12ish and could sleep only by around 4 or 5 in the morning and I slept for around 4 hours for the past couple of weeks. I started using melatonin for last week and it helped me get to sleep by 12. I used to sleep for 10 to 11 hours on melatonin. But last night, I didn't take melatonin. I went to bed at 12 and slept in a few mins, and woke up at approx 8. 
* I planned my family's trip to the US (have been wanting to do this for weeks) 
* I could never stay interested in a single topic for more than 10 mins max. I watched the entire Dota 2 loregasm playlist by SirActionSlacks. It has 12 videos and it took around 3.5 hours to finish. I watched the whole thing without any break. 
* I completed the tax return process on Sprintax. I still have to take a printout and mail it, but I got my w2 and access to Sprintax like more than a month ago and I've been procrastinating to finish it. 
* Finally, I usually don't write this long posts if I'm not on Adderall (diagnosed with ADHD), but I'm not on Adderall now.



I want to wait a couple of days to talk to my psychiatrist about this. Before that, I just wanted to make sure if it's Lexapro or a hypomanic or manic phase.";3324;140;638;65;67;1073;277;811

The positive to it is that she comes highly recommended from a GP who previously worked with her at a mental health facility, and the three months might go quickly and of course the chances are she will take me on.

464;bipolarreddit;ecot0ne;09/02/2019;"My behavior isn’t registering with me. Feeling a bit messy cognitively. How do you achieve self awareness? I’ve had a weird two months now with some mixed mania stuff. I feel like I’ve been doing better recently, because I’m not really doing to any risky type things anymore and I haven’t had any fits of rage, and I feel somewhat normal I think and in my perception I feel like I seem good and stable. None of this is being validated by anyone or anything. I feel extremely confused because like when I have a conversation I feel like I’m talking normally and in my head it’s making sense but I’ve had my therapist and some others telling me I need to slow down, calm down, or I get a look and then told I make no sense. I still haven’t regained any  appetite and have lost about 40 lbs since December and I have to force myself to eat to take my medication or I throw up when I take my meds. I keep not sleeping and it’s not like I don’t want to sleep because I do, it’s like the concept of sleep isn’t occurring to me until I realize (like I don’t know how it got to be 5:57am right now or what I’ve actually been doing since around 10 pm) that the sun’s about to come up. I tried to put gas in my car today and couldn’t remember my pin for my debit and it only came back to me like 3 hours later. I had another weird bit where I couldn’t recall my sister’s name for like a half hour. I wasn’t talking to her or anyone but it was like I could see her face in my head that she was my sister but it was mentally straining and very unsettling. They don’t feel like typical moments where you forget what something means.

I’m on 7 meds right now to try quash the manic stuff I had going on and I think they’ve done their job in that respect, but my head is feeling  very cognitively fucked up  and not like I’m a drunk or in sedated way but just like everything feels sharp in my head and important but I can’t figure out what it is? I don’t know how to explain it. I guess what I’m seeing in myself isn’t what others are seeing me and i don’t know if they’re lying, because I’m usually very self aware and I can’t tell if it’s me, or the medications since I got switched from latuda to vraylar and had some sedatives added on. And then it’s confusing because the cognitive symptoms I’m feeling aren’t being noticed, or at least acknowledged by anyone but they keep talking about things I’m doing behaviorally even though I swear I’m very calm and I don’t feel manic anymore and I’m not seeing it in me what they say they’re seeing. I don’t know what or who to believe or even why I’m still on 7 mqedications at this point.

What are some self awareness techniques some of you use? I can’t afford to fuck up again and I need this weird stuff to clear up fast.

I'm 23 and got diagnosed January 2018, and that's when I started on my medication.

I got the diagnosis after a massive manic episode, and in that manic state I actually thought I had finally found joy in life, and an end to my depression for good. A conclusion to my struggles ect ect. 

But that conclusion was ripped apart as I got the diagnosis. My so called happiness was taken away from me. (but being manic was of course very bad for my health since I hardly ever ate and I did reckless shit. You know classic mania 101)

When I started on the meds I kept telling myself that one day I'll be stable and then I will find a new and better conclusion/happiness. But it's been a year and I'm loosing my patience because I simply don't feel better than what I did before my manic episode, before the aggressive depression that lasted a year, even before there even was a build-up to that depression.

(I'm starting to tear up as I write this)

I can't live with my own thoughts. They always focus on the pessimistic side of things. And even in bright times they seem to spiral down into some negative memory that involves either depression or mania. (all my memories of the mania has turned negative because it's now clear to me how much of an asshole I was, and all the bad/irresponsible shit I did that had consequences on behalf of my friends and people I knew). And these spiraling thoughts always come out of nowhere. 

Whenever I take my meds I get reminded of the fact that I will be taking them for the rest of my life. That I'll never be ""Normal"" and that I might not get to a state where I can call myself happy.

I guess for some preface I was diagnosed last year but have had it all my life. I'm type 1 but was pretty functional as I typically used what I now realize is my mania in school and etc. and pretty much was excelling despite going through manic and depressive episodes (thinking it was normal/teenage angst etc.) until about my 4th year in college when things went down south fast. Fast forward two years, a couple of hospital visits, and finally getting a full wrap around team, I'm a lot more stable now that I'm on what I feel are the right set of meds for me atm (been on a set of lithium, lorazepram, and buproprion for the past 3 months and it's worked amazingly). It's allowed me to work, write, and just generally focus like I used to without the mood swings and recognize when I'm becoming manic or depressed at high caliber level that I'm used to. I know that the meds aren't a cure all and that relapse happens, but recently have had a string of events (good, bad, and otherwise) have caused my depression to come back in full swing. I recognize it for what it is and why I feel like this, which is a huge step compared to before, but it's just as heavy and still rather difficult to deal with unlike my mania where I  know just to tune it down. I don't really know what I'm looking for in this as i have a pretty solid support system, but I guess if anyone else has had relapse experiences post medication I think hearing about others dealt with hearing about it would be helpful. Because I'm really in a spot where Im really not sure how to approach it and could probably use some netflix/movie suggestions as I don't have much energy to do anything else.

Although I did have tactile hallucinations at some point but I'm nots ure what was going on at that time. I've noticed a pattern for years but idk. Didn't think that could be it since itit's supposed to be uncommon at least compared to other disorders and I dont know of any family history, though I've wondered about my bio grandfather. He was abusive, angry, and I guess he did drugs. I think my grandma said he used to be really smart and charming but he was lazy. Idk. Anyway no one talks to him and he won't help anyway.

I don't feel like typing out a history right now so maybe I'll edit later but for now theres my post history.

&amp;#x200B;

I sometimes wonder but then chalk it up to stress and insomnia and midterms and some sort of atypical depression/mood disorder but nah not bipolar. And now here I am thinking fuc. I was probably right ten years ago. I'd stopped thinking it was a possibility and then found out in 2016 that I had a cyclothymia diagnosis. I think at that time I had never been fully honest about how bad my depression could be because I was scared to tell her. Even after several years I guess. But it's not like shes a therapist.

Anyway I seem to get angrier, less patient, sleep less though my energy isn't necessarily up, spend more money (used to be on food and stuff but it wasnt bad until last year and maybe this year) sometimes talk more. Maybe even lower tolerance for boredom than usual.

I was a god awful person to my then boyfriend. I knew I needed to fix myself, so I went to my psych, asked for a med switch, made an appointment with a new therapist, all that jazz.

My actions were just not something my boyfriend could move past. And I don't blame him. I was inconsiderate of his feelings at a delicate time and really hurt him. He broke up with me at the end of January.

I told my therapist all about the breakup, all the issues we had, all the fights we had, but I also told her about all the wonderful things. Those were so much more important things to me than any disagreement. We left that topic for a while to work on other things. In my appointment today, we circled back. She said ""it honestly sounds like you two would have been a perfect match if mental illness wasn't as big an issue as it was."" This broke my heart. I have been trying to forget about it, leave well enough alone, or just understand the fact that he's never coming back, and I'll never get to talk to him again (we ended with no contact).

I started doing pilates to strengthen my core and my arms. I walk my two dogs through the woods 5 days a week. 

However, thanks to magic of seroquel, I'm still kinda fat. I'm right at the line of healthy/overweight on the bmi index (seriously if I lost 1/2 pound I'd be in the healthy category). 

I'm watching what I eat, getting loads of veggies, switched out most carbs for alternatives, even cut down on my one major weakness : potato chips. My fitness pal says I'm running a 300+ calorie deficit most days. 

But I look in the mirror and I don't see much improvement. My arms are a little more toned, I can see my cheekbones more clearly. But that's about it. 

I know that the exercise IS making me healthier. My heart, my lungs, my strength. But I wish I could see the results more. I wish I got to shop for new clothes, to show off my hard work. 

To top it off a friend of mine recently lost about 20 Pounds just by cutting out the insane amounts of candy and soda she was consuming. And everyone is gushing over how good she looks. 

I know this is a real pity party I'm throwing for myself. But I do crave that outside validation at times. Because I can't even share with the majority of my friends the reason I'm struggling with my size. Nothing makes the average conversation more awkward than tossing around the word ""antipsychotics"".

I'm asking on behalf of my non-tech mum.

She is over 50, she was diagnosed with bpd just last year. She started having symptomes after her thyroid was removed (due to the risk of cancer) and she is on thyroid hormones.

She was always more on the ""maniac"" side and by this I mean never depressed, always energetic and doing more things at once than one person could be capable of. Then the ""first depression"" came, then again she was up with her mood and from that time the extreme swings started, finally causing a 3-months long deep depressive state. So she went to psychiatrist (some professor someone reccomended her) who prescribed her some meds (idk exactly what, but something more like a 1st generation lithium thing?). He told she does not need to go to the therapy as this is purely physical (like the ""chemicals in the brain"") thing, not managable with therapy.

At first there was a huge improvement after just two weeks and it lasted about six months of really minor swings and neutral state.

But now she is back at the deep depression state and I am worried that meds are not right. I know absolutelty nothing about bipolar other than what internet taught me, but I have a feeling that a) those meds might not be well-suited for her? b) she should at least try therapy?

She obv does not want to go to any other doctor, she kinda feels uncurable at this point and even blames herself for the state, and blindly listens to the ""professor with years of experience"". Idk, can you hint me with things that worked for you so I can try and advise her on? Would therapy be useful? And if so, what type of therapy?

It was about ten years ago that I hear bipolar disorder is a progressive mental illness. I scoffed at it- I had been at the “same level” of mental illness from the start. 

Then all of a sudden, three years ago, all hell broke loose. I became insanely manic. I was hallucinating and ocd tendencies came out of nowhere. I was convinced that the planes that crashed into the 9/11 towers were going to crash into my home and the only way to stop them was to lock and unlock and lock my door again. 

After what felt like forever, that manic phase passed and I had the realization that I had hit a new level of my mental illness. My manic phases have become a monster of their own- I was never nearly this bad before. The lows are deeper, the suicidal thoughts have gotten more frequent (though I would never ever follow through- I love my kids too much). Everything thing feels so much BIGGER, if that makes sense. 

What was now something in the back of my head as a teenager, “Yeah I have bipolar disorder but I never even think about it, I’m too busy living my life. “ Has now become my biggest priority to keep in check and it’s almost all I think about.

510;bipolarreddit;familyofthings;19/04/2019;"Psychosis (Possible Self Harm) Hi; this is my first post to this subreddit, and to reddit in general! I am a long-time lurker. I am sorry if it's long--

I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder in late August after a manic, then psychotic, break that ended with 5 days in the psych ward. I did some severely out-of-character and even violent things while in the ward. I have trouble looking back and thinking what I could have done differently--my husband and sponsor took me to the emergency room, and I said (out of my mind) ""I think that's part of it"" to the question ""does this have to do with harm to yourself or others."" 

Then, everything escalated: the security guards grabbed me and moved me to a holding room. I nearly passed out from the anxiety spike. My brain was making me talk to everyone and learn their names, I think, as a coping mechanism. Eventually, after a long time in a room with scary doctor people (to my scared mind) coming in and out, I was driven, handcuffed, by police to the psych place. I am told by my therapist and friends that I am very smart and that that made things a little worse for me. My brain had SO MANY false narratives going, and not only was I manic but I was in such fight or flight, I ended up in seclusion rooms twice. This, as you can imagine, made everything tons worse. I felt so isolated. I feel traumatized, still.  

I went back to work right after. My sponsor stopped talking to me completely, and I don't have a large support group, even though I have been feeling a little more connected to people day-to-day. I want to go back and change everything; I want to believe that the right thing happened; but, being completely ignorant to what I could do, I said things that led to the worst situation for me. The ward experience seemed to make everything a lot worse--the delusions, the mania, the disconnectedness, the alienation, overmedicating, etc. 

I am now pretty stable and on a mood stabilizer, hydroxyzine, and a sleep med. How do you all cope with decisions that you or your loved ones made for you that you wish went differently? How do you deal with the trauma of hospitalization? I know everyone has different, even positive, experiences. Mine was not that. It's hard not to let it eat at me and get angry. 

Thanks for listening.";1793;67;334;43;31;582;219;429
511;bipolarreddit;Fantafyren;23/03/2019;Recently started treatment, and I was told to double my quetiapine dose last night, but got hit with some kinda scary side effects. Is that normal? So, my psychiatrist wanted me to double my dose from 50mg to 100mg last night, and I did.  As soon as the meds start to kick in, my heart starts beating like crazy and I get this extremely dizzy feeling, like I am about to pass out any second. At times it feels like my body just starts falling, as I lay in the bed. I have taken a lot of different drugs, but this feeling made me panick a bit, thinking I might be allergic or something. A couple of hours in, and the symptons didn't change, so I figured, that if it was something that was truly dangerous, surely my symptoms must have gotten worse by now, and I went to bed. Didn't feel any side effects this morning, except for some pretty bad shoulder pain, but that started while I was on 50mg. Are these normal side effects, and I just have to get used to them? Didn't feel anything like that at all, while I was on 50mg. But I have only been in treatment for like 5 days, so most of you know better than me. I also took 10mg of zopiclone (about 5mg of lunesta/eszopiclone) last night, and some melatonin. I am also on a lot of tramadol and sometimes some instant release oxycontin, due to some pain I got after being admitted to the hospital with acute pancreatitis. Which is actually how I found out I have bipolar. so maybe it had something to do with mixing it? I have been on zopiclone for over 6 years though, and never experienced anything like that. Thanks for reading it all! I hope some of you can help me out, since I am kinda new to this, and can't call my psychiatris till monday. ;1326;47;264;15;20;429;171;336
512;bipolarreddit;fashionstudy;08/02/2018;"Psychosis triggerd by bodytherapy Hi Guys,

I have had a psychotic episode 2x. In between my recovering fases I noticed that massage therapy was a trigger for me too sliding back and loosing it. After I noticed it the second time I called up some masseuse therapists and came to find out: They have a contra-indication for massages. Meaning they dont do massage therapy on people who have psychiatric problems. The reason being that massaging the body does something to the mind. It can release emotions that are ""stuck"" in your body and these emotions can trigger you.

That was really a bummer for me because whenever I was stressed and needed relaxation I would take a massage.

I have been looking into things like: Meditation, Reiki, Breath therapy and Bio energetica. But often their is a contra -indication.

I wanted to know if any of you also feel their is a body mind connection? And that things that happen to your body can be a trigger. Would love to hear experiences. I would do anything to stay stable &amp; healthy. But I need to find a way how to cope with stress and how to relax my body in a way it wont be triggered.";902;45;149;18;15;293;123;209

So the last couple of weeks for around 8 days, I felt horrendous, I wanted to die so badly, I couldn’t find a way out. That was just after I had been overly happy, cleaned everything, started volunteering for a charity and was feeling productive and somewhat irritated this lasted around 4 days. 

Now this week (or more so right now) I feel flat and annoyed with everyone, I feel as if I’m fine and normal, I’m not worried about passing my exams because I feel okay but flat, I’ve been like this for 2 days now. I went to the doctor after years of feeling unstable recently and now today I feel as if I’ve been dramatic by going to the doctor, they said it sounds like I may have bipolar and I am waiting for a further mental health assessment.

Many people around me tell me they think I’ve got bipolar but I truly think I’ve messed up by going to the doctor in the first place and actually everything is fine.

When I am not feeling okay I know that actually I am unwell but I feel fine now and I don’t want to talk to any other professionals about this potential bipolar diagnosis when I am fine and feeling as if this is just who I am. Sometimes I’m a bubbly funny person, sometimes I am very low- now I’ve had a professional say it’s potential bipolar I am in total denial of anything being wrong.

519;bipolarreddit;FlandersFields2018;15/04/2019;"Benzo Tolerance Issues Hey everyone, I've been on benzos for about a year and a few months (Klonopin at first and now Xanax on top of it) and I've noticed that not only have I grown a tolerance (which I obv. expected) but it's gotten to the point where it barely does anything, even if I take higher dosages. I started at .5 mg of Klonopin and now I'm at up to 1.5 mg per day (prescribed by my doctor). Even at the upper level it doesn't do much. With Xanax, I have to take like 3-4 mg just to feel what I used to get with .5 or 1 mg. Of course I know that's getting to the point of substance abuse which is a problem I don't wanna have.

Has anyone else experienced benzo tolerance getting to a point where you have to take very excessive amounts just for a small benefit? Also, I'm considering tapering down for a short while so that if I end up taking more than my regular dose it actually helps instead of barely registering. Do a few weeks of taking lower amounts help somewhat reset tolerance for any chronic benzo users or does it just cause withdrawal to worsen/is not worth it? Looking for any advice, thanks!

532;bipolarreddit;footwords;02/01/2019;"Seeking advice on a close friend who is having her first episodes. I've got a very close family friend who seems to be experiencing her first experiences with bipolar. Her mother was diagnosed bipolar. My friend has had what clearly seem to be manic episodes with full-on hallucinations as well as very depressive episodes. She believes that her hallucinations are her having a spiritual experience. Even when she is depressed, she thinks she is being punished for her behavior. She thinks the truth of the world is being revealed to her.

&amp;#x200B;

We've been talking to her family and they are afraid to take her to the hospital against her will. The problem is that she is convinced that she is right and everyone is conspiring against her to label her as sick and that they just want to give her drugs to kill her. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are the other options available to her and her family? Are psychiatrists available for in-home care or diagnosis? How can she get help when she refuses to believe that she has a problem?  I'm scared for her safety because her depression gets extremely severe. She thinks that a mass shooting happed because she went out to a club one night. She thinks her small behaviors put peoples lives at risk. She hasn't admitted to being suicidal but I know that there's a strong link between this condition and suicide attempts and it seems like a bad idea to wait for it to get to that point.

&amp;#x200B;

We tried to wait it out for a while to see if her episodes would let up temporarily enough for her to see that she needs help but she seems to go straight from manic to depressed and back without any break. Or, if there is a break it doesn't seem to matter because she thinks everything she's experienced is real and that we can't see the truth. The only time she said she wanted help, she meant help in finding someone who will validate her hallucinations.

Last Wednesday and Thursday night I threw up all my meds because of Latuda nausea. Last night I forgot to pick up my Lamictal refill from the pharmacy so went without it.

Normally I can’t go more than four hours past taking my nightly Lamictal dose of 400 mg without horrible and intense withdrawal. It puts me in a severe mixed episode with suicidal ideation and planning. Every time I throw up my meds or miss a dose I prepare for some of the worse hours of my life until I can take my dose again.

I’ve been on it since 2006, and have been at this high dose for probably at least 8 years.

I had been diagnosed as all sorts of things before we settled on this. The medication has been working well now that I’m on the right things and I’ve made a couple lifestyle changes, like spending less time with my more reckless friends and not sleeping because I just could. 

And all of that has been going very well, and so is therapy. But this week I had a realization, about how messed up a lot of my mental relationships with things like sex and my past romantic relationships. On particular the combination of those two things and a lot of anger and shame about how I’ve handled things in the past. 

What I realized this week in therapy was my perspective has been all about limiting symptoms and episodes, I’ve been sleeping cause it makes me feel better. But I have been mad at myself for a long time about how I handled a breakup without changing the underlying behavior, and not thinking about how it  has kept me in the same place. And that is an awesome realization. 

But what scares me is contending with the behavior. How I’m going to change what I’m doing not how I feel. I realize the two are connected but adding the other mode is scary. I’ve always thought that you can say I did this because of my bipolar and that explains the behavior but doesn’t excuse it.

546;bipolarreddit;fujiwaranofuckboy;17/04/2018;"(xpost from /r/bipolar)Weird experience with latuda monotherapy? Advice? Throwaway account cause i don't really use reddit, i just needed some advice

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about a month ago and started taking latuda about 20 days ago. The initial 20mg dosage gradually killed my (at the time) current hypomanic episode within a week, which was fantastic! I also noticed some, but not all, depressive feelings being held at bay, which was nice, if not quite optimal.

However, I bumped up to 30mg about a week ago, and 2 days after that, I had a psychotic episode until the next morning-I felt incredibly debilitating dissociative symptoms and I felt like my body was acting seperately from my mind in a way that was trying to kill me. I couldnt really talk, and mentally, I felt completely void and couldnt form a coherent thought. (my experience was a lot like that of this blog post: https://blogs.psychcentral.com/bipolar-mom/2012/03/i-had-a-medication-induced-psychotic-episode/). Since I have bp2, mania with that much cognitive and physical impairment isn't really normal for me.

Anyways, after that experience my psychiatrist recommended that I cut back to 20mg latuda (which seemed to help with hypomania to some degree) until the end of the college semester, and we planned to experiment with med cocktails after the summer. With all this in mind, I'd like to have some sort of plan going forward. Is there a safe way I can continue to ramp up my latuda dose (i.e. in conjunction with a stronger antimanic agent like lithium)? Or should I quit latuda and try a different drug entirely?";1299;54;197;36;17;411;159;274
547;bipolarreddit;FullOfHotAir;11/02/2018;"Experiences with Lamictal and hypomania? Experiences getting off Lamictal? Hi! This is my first time posting here. If I may, do any of you have experiences with what I put in my title?


Here's some (not super necessary for answering my questions) background:

I have a diagnosis of Bipolar type 2. While for many reasons I still believe this to be accurate, I've been questioning the role that Lamictal has played in my illness and diagnosis.

While I had had many sort of hypo-hypomanic periods before, and had actually been diagnosed before at age 13, my first full blown, classically symptomatic hypomanic episode coincided with starting and then increasing my dose of Lamictal. This particular episode was used as a part of my diagnosis. (I started Lamictal due to a severe upswing in my depression and history of not responding to antidepressants.) The hypomania eventually faded back into my more typical depressions and general emotional static. This was then further complicated by the addition of other meds that I did not do well with at all. It's a bit of a tangle, so attempting to determine if there's any sort of clear chain of cause and effect is difficult.

I've never had any other side effects, but I've also never really felt any steadier on Lamictal. Lithium is what eventually became a total godsend for me.

All of this is to say that I don't know if Lamictal has actually done anything positive for me. Yet I've been kept on it ever since and I'm questioning if this is only because I haven't had any side effects to complain about. If this is true, is there really any point to continuing to take it long term? If I don't have to spend the money every month and continue to risk the known short term and unknown long term side effects, I'd rather not.



So, has anyone else experienced hypomania that coincided with starting or increasing Lamictal? Has anyone gone through getting off of it? What is the process of doing that like?

I am, of course, not going to change anything without talking to my pdoc. I'd just like to hear from some other people with personal insight.

Thank you!";1689;87;271;57;27;577;192;384

When I met my wife four years ago, I didn't know I'd get this bad. I had a history of depression and anxiety disorder, but I was keeping it controlled without medication. Two years ago I had a breakdown and had to go back into therapy, which led to now. 

My wife and I always talked about having kids, but the worse I feel the less I feel like I'd make a good dad. I barely feel like getting up to go to work, let alone do all the chores that are already piled up around the house. I can't imagine putting a kid on top of all that. Not to mention, I'd hate to bring someone else into the world and they feel as bad as I do. It seems selfish of me to have a kid on a whim and then end up being a shitty dad.

I'm trying to figure out how to present this to my psychiatrist. I think I've been in a manic episode for the last 2-3 weeks or so especially. I had started thinking this on Saturday and my significant other said he thought I seemed like I was manic for the last few weeks.

My psych doc put me on 20 mg of prozac which I initially thought was making me really zombie like but then I went on a tinder spree. I have promiscuous tendencies when drinking but I usually don't actually do anything. I hit on an old boyfriend once, but otherwise have been faithful to my SO.

In the past month, I have had sex with 3 different guys and had a multi hookup with one that I've basically been texting nonstop. I've been pounding energy drinks and alcohol, and tindering, and wanting to go out and do things and talk to people and dance which is weird for me because I'm introverted. 

My SO confronted me Friday night/Saturday and everything kind of crashed back and I'm having a what the fuck did I do moment.

I felt GOOD last week. I actually felt like I had some energy despite still not sleeping any better than usual (I have bad insomnia). That never happens, and I want to cry because if it is actually bipolar, I'm not going to get to feel like that again. My psychiatrist thinks my baseline is a depressed mood (which I'm now in again). So basically I get to spend the rest of my life depressed and I don't want to have to live like that.

How do I bring this up to my doctor? I have been drinking a lot, so I'm worried she is going to dismiss it as a by product of that instead of something else. I've taken mood stabilizers in the past without much improvement in the depression, but the focus was on the depression. I'm assuming my doctor has ruled out bipolar already.

Sorry if it’s a bit long .
Basically after about 5 years of therapy at multiple hospitals with multiple people I got diagnosed with bipolar 2. It was such a relief to know what was wrong with me and why these sudden breakdowns and well “mental” episodes had been happening to me. It fit and was comforting having confirmation that it’s not me or who I am. 
I have bad depressive episodes roughly every two years, always when I’m perfectly content with my life, no events no reasonable triggers nothing. 

Manics have been less visible to my hospital as well I was off doing “far more important things” 
E.g my ,now I look back on it, completely incoherent master piece of an application to a prestigious design school.  Instead of attending appointments. Although they did see a couple days which confirmed to them bipolar. 

In between those times I’m just normal happy average George. 

So getting to the point my second admittion to the priory hospital ( private so not related to my previous treatment) happened last year during a depressive episode.  In one session my consultant told me he didn’t think it was bipolar. I asked why, his response was nothing more than” you don’t look like someone with bipolar” 

What the fuck does that mean?!? 

So he told me in his opinion it’s BPD. Disregarding my previous YEARS under the nhs who All agreed on bipolar. 

Now I’m out patient and have been back home nearly a year and doing really well despite  Having  had loss and a difficult home life.  he’s referred me to a therapist. Turns out she only treats personality disorders. 

I had my first session with her and she went through the criteria of what is needed for a diagnosis of bpd.  ( that’s what he had changed my diagnosis to on my notes!!!) I’ve met him maybe 5 times over two years including inpatient stays. 

Now with bipolar I do have the symptoms she is describing but only when I have episodes. When I made it clear it’s only in episodes that these are present and my episodes tend to be separated by months or years where none of these symptoms exist she scoffed and said that doesn’t matter and ticked them off anyway. 

Im finding it hard having people try to make out that the way I am when I’m ill is a problem with my personality and therefore something I can control. 

I came to this subreddit as I’m hoping you understand how horrible it is for someone to 1. Make out like you have control over this by changing your thinking. 2. And taking away the only thing that makes sense of why I do and say and feel these intense almost out of body episodes. I know full well it’s not like me to go out for three days and not sleep going to random places not having any sense of danger and losing who I am. 

I’m not putting anyone with bpd down. It’s just a very different experience when it feels chemical. I would choose bipolar over bpd any day because I have long periods of time of being normal. 
I’m really scared they are going to change my meds and what treatments they’ll give me. 

Anyone had similar to this???

576;bipolarreddit;GlamMamTV;23/02/2018;"Am i bipolar? ive got a doctors appointment booked but im so nervous im thinking about cancelling Ive recently been experiencing moods which could suggest i may be bipolar, even getting to the point where i almost ended a 13 year relationship with my BF (in which we have 3 children together) because I felt i didn't love him anymore, only to now fall madly and deeply back in love with him, this all happened in a matter of 2 months and i have had this cycling feeling for almost about 2 years now, but its seems like the moods are getting stronger and i am now acting on them. Ive been hiding my depressive moods from people so no one really knows whats going on only my BF, i now tell him everything im feeling which i think has helped massively so far and he is so supportive.
I also have rushing thoughts daily but ive just always put that down to that just being me, i just thought it was normal.
i can also have obsessive thoughts and this could be on a certain hobby or person (my BF) i will think about it all day long and my brain is hard to shut off at night sometimes. i always have to have the tv on to fall asleep to distract my brain.
i get rushes of creativity and productivity. i can be super excited and obsessive about a project/s only forget about them and almost never finish what i plan to do or have started. i end up losing all interest.
I find it hard to concentrate for too long and i get easily distracted and im very forgetful. 
 My BF made a doctors appointment for me (because i was to nervous that the receptionist might ask me what the problem was and i know i would have freaked out if she had asked me, and i don't know why) Now im really anxious about this appointment just incase i tell the doctor everything and hes gonna tell me im being too dramatic or maybe not even believe me. im having my BF come with me for support but i know im gonna get so nervous im not gonna be able to speak because i know im gonna forget all of this.
Any insight or advice i would be so grateful for. I have been doing some research on bipolar, in one respect i would feel really relieved if it is bipolar but then on the other hand its super scary to think i could have a mental disorder as i have been completely healthy all my life and never thought i would ever have something like this. 
Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer some words of wisdom.

578;bipolarreddit;GoatMoatBoatStout;24/02/2018;"creative work and getting way, way overly excited? So for years, because I haven't been able to do any normal job, I've been making creative projects at home as my ""job"". But I've always had extremely huge trouble actually getting creative work done, even though I'm never not extremely passionate about my projects, even when I'm really depressed.

I'm now on Lamictal, and have been for a few months, and holy f'ing shit it makes such a huge different and I think it's going to save my entire future. One thing I wasn't expecting was that it's given me tons of insight into what feelings and levels of excitement and joy aren't actually normal, because I now barely ever get them totally randomly out of the blue (except when I was off the meds for a few days and it was... yeah). But obviously they're not 100% gone.

So the point of the post is...
I'm realizing so much about why putting in the time to create things was always so difficult: because pretty much every single time I would then hypomanic-ish feelings would come up and it would make functioning so difficult. I would usually get so overstimulated I had to stop, or I'd keep going but then have a massive crash into depression a few days later, if I started working on something at night then instead of sleeping after I'd have to spend hours obsessing over how amazing the thing I'm making is. And I guess I knew this already, that this happens, but now it's like ""WOW SO THESE FEELINGS **AREN'T** NORMAL? NO WONDER THEY INCAPACITATED ME"". And because I'm more consciously aware of them, I've been trying to practice working on stuff WITHOUT getting sucked down the rabbit hole of having these intense feelings. And even on drugs that help, it's fucking difficult. I can do only an hour of being productive and then my mood and energy is just totally different afterwards and it's so exhausting, but stopping and trying to relax immediately helps me not spin into something for hours or days that leaves me completely drained. And also it's no fucking wonder that my anxiety around starting a work session never got better after years, because it could result in such intense draining awful things.

So I'm wondering who here can relate?

When I read about bipolar I don't see anything about how the uppy-feelings can be triggered so incredibly easily and consistently by one thing, which is why I didn't see things from this perspective before. But now that I don't really get those feelings randomly without reason since being on Lamictal, I see how abnormal they are and now recognize that's why other creative people are able to get so much done, because working on something creative for over an hour doesn't make life into the most exciting thing ever in the world. But even on pills I still get the feelings pretty much every time when working on anything I'm passionate about. So yeah, I dunno, hoping people can relate because I don't want to feel so alone and freakish and broken anymore.";2380;103;394;47;36;777;248;555

583;bipolarreddit;GomezTE;26/02/2019;"I used amphetamines to trigger mania. So I have bipolar II and since I started medication (mood stabilizers with ssri's that supposedly affect the noradrenaline (don't know the correct english term) just like stimulants)
Since I started this I managed to pull out of my cannabis addiction, alcohol problem and get my grades up.

Last year I tried elvanse (active substanse lisdex(in swedish) amphetamine on two occasions and it triggered a full blown mania episode for a solid month. Like not even hypomania, mania.

Today I did the same but I could only get my hands on normal street amphetamines, I snorted around 0.3g of it on different occasions between 07:00 and 13:30, where I snorted 0.2g. The effect should wear off around 21:30. Should I expect the same thing?

I am very careful when it comes to this, and I know it's a bad idea just talking about the substance itself. But how bad is this, could this lead to developing bipolar I? I had a much worse deppressive period during autumn than I usually do. The same duration but worse and it led to drug/alkohol problems when I first started ssri without mood stabilizers.

I am certain this period was because the stimulant even though I only used it twice during spring when I didn't have any medication. But could this be remedied by just using this substance every couple of month and keeping my regular medications?

584;bipolarreddit;goodbyecrowpie;29/03/2019;"I need energy! So back in September I finally came out of a multi-year depression, and since then I’ve been getting CBT which has helped so much. But I’m still dealing with daily fatigue. I have a fairly light school/work schedule right now and it still tires me out. I feel like I’m really being held back by it and worried I won’t be able to go away to grad school. I’m exhausted from the moment I get up in the morning, and I’m finding it really hard to sit down and write. It’s mental as well as physical fatigue, hard to focus my brain on anything. I miss feeling “sharp”.

I’m dx’d BP2 + BPD + OCD tendencies, but I haven’t experienced true hypomania in a very long time—I’m more prone to mixed episodes/irritability. I *do* experience occasional psychotic episodes (paranoia, delusions, that make my brain feel like it's been electrocuted and often leaves me ""hungover""), but these (in addition to most of my self harm urges) seem to be a result of the BPD as opposed to the Bipolar. I’ve been on lamotrigine (225 mg) since 2012/2013 + went on bupropion (Wellbutrin) almost 2 years ago (200 mg). The bupro I went on to try to bring myself out of depression; it worked a bit, and I tolerate it, but nothing miraculous.

Now that I’m not in a depression, though, and I’m *still* so tired, I’m wondering what else to do. My doctor ran a bunch of bloodwork and my iron was kinda low, but taking iron supplements hasn’t fixed anything. I even tried taking Cytomel despite (hypo end of) normal thyroid testing, but it made me very ragey and I had to stop. My Dr’s temp suggested that maybe it’s the lamotrigine causing fatigue, which is interesting, and I might try bringing it down a titch, but a couple years ago I lowered it a bit (under supervision) and my self-harm urges went up. But I also want to try lowering it a bit for brain fog reasons (i.e., it gives me brain fog).

So! While that’s something I can try, I’m also wondering about energizing adjuncts. Wellbutrin is not giving me energy (or, if it is, I’d hate to see how I am without it)—(nor is it raising my libido or suppressing my cravings; it just seems to have given me tinnitus but I’m still worried about going off it because this is still the most stable/non-depressed I’ve been in years). Tbh at the end of last semester I turned to energy drinks in desperation, and—they don’t make me manic? Sometimes I barely feel them. Still, those are obviously not great to be using. 

So I’ve been looking into modafinil/armodafinil, and Vyvanse … I imagine I would stay on lamotrigine because I overall tolerate it and it seems to be doing *something* … 

Sorry this is rambly, and yes I’ve used search for past threads but—

**tl;dr – Any thoughts on adding modafinil/armodafinil** ***or*** **Vyvanse to lamotrigine? Any other ideas on ways to gain energy? Is this the lamotrigine? The bipolar itself? Something else??**

I just started 450mg of the extended release type of Lithium last night. I took it after a meal but by the time it hit my stomach I had really bad nausea. I went and laid down and after about 30 mins that passed thankfully. I woke up during the night quite thirsty and today I have been drinking plenty of water. 

I have been feeling dizzy at times, have been sweaty - sometimes hot flashes and then feel cold later. Hands and feet sweating a lot. Also I am feeling very anxious (there is a lot going on in my life so that would make sense but I wasn’t anxious this badly and in this way before the lithium). I feel ‘out of it’ too - like dissociated maybe - the anxiety makes this scary, although I am in a rational state of mind. I also have a feeling of just being a bit unwell in some hard to define way. I feel a icky lol

I have no symptoms of toxicity at all thankfully. No shakes. However searching reddit and Google I can’t kind anyone reporting anxiety, dizziness and feeling slightly out of it and unwell. I know it is early days and I might need to adjust but after hours of obsessive Googling and worry I just need some feedback as to whether what I am feeling is normal or not? 

I am also on Lamictal 200mg but have been for many months already. I was on 25mg Seroquel since the Friday before last to help with sleep but my last dose of that was Saturday night. I stopped it as it wasn’t helping me sleep and I was getting no benefit.

If anyone has some experience with lithium I’d really appreciate some reassurance. Especially regarding the feeling of not quite being here or right in some way.

593;bipolarreddit;greatbooks28;23/03/2018;"I gave up my old career in return for a happier, healthier life. I went to medical school as a healthy, bright 18 year old, but within the first year I had my first major depressive episode and suicide attempt. At 19 I had my first manic phase - a month long binge with multiple sexual partners, drug use, and irrepressible urges to study all night. Spontaneous and irresponsible acts were my forte; I decided that Morocco was my spirit country, and whisked myself off the next day. I gained a reputation amongst my friends as mercurial and fun, but inside I was imploding; my second suicide attempt followed the month after.

In my mind the problem was Medicine. This stressful, hypercompetitive environment was obviously causing my mood swings; no way was this an organic health problem. So I left med school at the beginning of 4th year, and began teaching Maths - and I was great at it! This career change had solved all of my problems, and I was tippety top flying high fantastic! Life couldn't get better, right?

Wrong. The depression came back, harder than ever, sending me spiralling down into a deep, dark chasm. I was admitted to hospital and diagnosed properly, treated and sent on my way a month later, armed with mood stabilisers, CBT worksheets and a new found passion for yoga. I thought I could just ride the wave, surfing with the sun on my face when times were good, and paddling against the tide when times got bad. I never imagined I'd be dragged under again.

But I was. The stress of teaching caught up. The long hours, the constant need to be 'on' and engaging, the marking, the data tracking, the free time spent planning, the expectations, the meetings - they slowly pulled me down until I was drowning, exhausted from fighting the tide, and ready to accept defeat.

But three months ago I stopped fighting. I left teaching, and I felt the wave pull me up, lifting me toward the surface. Each day that I got up was a victory that brought me closer to sunlight. I chose to leave behind the stress that was threatening my survival and anchoring me to the ocean floor and I put myself first. 

In a few weeks time I start a job working part time as an activities coordinator for the same psychiatric hospital group that I was admitted as an inpatient to. I tutor for an online company, and I'm happy.

Got into my dream school after five years, no self-confidence, not solod on resources, too much pressure, depressive cycling, poor performance, got kicked out. Took time off, made a bunch of promises. Three months back in the school (everyone was so happy) and I was kicked out again. 

The depressive episodes and ensuing nastiness fed (feed) off of my extreme guilt and fear from a lack of support structure and having ruined my opportunities already at this age and crashed my big dream.

I was ""discouraged"" from working so I could not always comfortably cover psych and meds. All I wanted was to be free. Any money I receive came with strings attached with the subtext that I would do what 'normal people' do- get a degree to be a valid person with a future (*like your sibling* narrative). 

So I lied about school, lied about my health, trying the same things over because I wanted the help I recieved to be valid and prove myself as ""not problematic"". Then I hid the drop out. I am terrified of the person of influence who I lied to the most. 

I wrote a letter clearly explaining that I am not ""better"" than ""other people"" with mental illnesses and need to reevaluate my choices because continuing to try when I just keep cycling is stupid. 

I did not receive a good response. To me admitting my fear of failure, shame, and poor mental health- a sentence, and $50. No contact for a month. So I know what to expect. 

 I hurt them by lying, since they put in alot of time and money to help me get this far. But they were really calculated and nasty in the past and I don't know if the rug will get pulled from under me by coming clean.

Now I sitting in this place I won't have the money for soon, on a phone that will get shut off, havent seen my psych in two months, trying to imagine a future different from the only one I ever imagined, or not being homeless.

If that doesn’t make sense to you, then you know what I recently realized ... I have no idea how much BP and BPD truly differ **in the details.**

I keep seeing BPD as a variation of bipolar ... maybe the “bipolar type 3” or something. But, it’s understandable. I live in the world of bipolar, and still haven’t gotten my meds right. 

So, I am one of those that sees bipolar in everyone ... even someone that coughs wrong.

I don't think I was stable for most of my adolescence. It is very scary for me to look back on my life. And think of how most of the times I really felt like MYSELF were when I was most likely manic. 

I used to be very goal-oriented, loved to learn, passionate about my hobbies. Just passionate, passionate, passionate.
But not always. I would slip into depressive phases and either lose interest in things or stop entirely.

When I think of myself, I think of someone is incredibly passionate. But that doesnt describe me at all. I feel like a husk who used to be someone. I still like the same things. But I never learn, or do anything anymore.

I used to write essays for fun. I used to practice Japanese religiously. I used to be so passionate. 

The scary thing is. I think my passion and vigor was never me. It was mania.

I'm scared that I was never anything but manic or depressed. I'm scared that's all I'll be. Or a husk.

The only moments where I feel like myself are when I'm passionate and working hard. But I haven't felt a single flicker of that passion since I had my manic episode. 

I just feel blank. Sometimes depressed. Sometimes stable. Mostly bored. And I'm scared to feel passion sometimes. Because then...its mania. It must be mania.

Like everything inside me is wrong - all my bones ache as if they don't fit inside my body, like they want to burst out. Like I want to explode. It's a kind of intense restless agitation to which nothing brings relief. Sometimes I go for a run or bike ride to try calm myself down, but it doesn't have a big effect, and often I end up overexerting myself and get hurt. What appeals to me most in this state is the thought of hurting myself or not living or losing myself in drugs. It's very hard to keep myself from self-harming. I've been in this state for so long and I don't know how much more I can take. In the past I've described it as 'restlessness', because I don't know how else to describe it. But it's clear to me that it's much more than that.

Is this a mixed episode? I've been like this for so long... Sometimes they'll last for one day, sometimes days, sometimes weeks or maybe even months. I'll then have a brief period of respite before returning to the state I've described above. While in this state I can often get into a kind of semi-mania and get things done which I never thought I could - read books, make art, play music, write essays - but always with this horrible exploding depressive restlessness underneath. And it's extremely hard to motivate myself to do anything. But if I curl up in bed or try to calm down with a film or music, my heart begins to pound and shake my entire body, and the restlessness just gets worse and worse and I want to die.

I've tried lots of times to search on the internet for this kind of feeling, but I've never found anything.

I might be in a relative 'low', but there will always be the potential for a relative 'high' to emerge quickly out of this low. And vice versa. It's as if everything is there at once, as if I'm in a low and a high at the same time. Always fluctuating, but always wrong. It's awful. It has really impacted all aspects of my life. I've withdrawn from society and do not keep contact with anyone, and when I do meet people they are scared or unnerved by how bizarre my behaviour is.

I know it's unwise to seek opinions on the internet, but at this point in time I have no friends who I can talk to about this, and I don't have the money to see a doctor or psychologist.
If a redditor or two could give their thoughts on my state, it might help point me in the right direction.
Thank you.

605;bipolarreddit;guineagirlie;26/03/2018;"Starting to doubt I have bipolar? I'm a 26 year old woman. I was going through a really rough patch, considering suicide, etc. So I booked an appointment with a doctor. The doctor referred me to another doctor who discussed the possibility of having bipolar. At the time it made sense, I could see how I fit many of the symptoms. 
In order to get a proper diagnosis, I need to first speak w a psychiatrist. I have an appointment this Thursday. 

I'm now starting to seriously doubt that I have bipolar. I'm no longer feeling so down, i actually feel fine. I'm starting to question whether I have bipolar or if I'm just being a little dramatic? Doesn't everyone do wild stuff now and again? My friends all have crazy stories of wild shit they've done. All similar to mine. And normal people feel down sometimes too. Right??

I'm dreading going to this appointment on Thursday because I'm embarrassed to explain that there's nothing wrong with me, I'm just dramatic and a bit of a cry baby. What should I do? Should I cancel or go and just apologise for wasting this doctors time?? Or could this all be in my head??? Help lol ";885;42;161;17;21;295;125;216
606;bipolarreddit;guyamassonora;11/01/2018;"Maybe I should throw up my meds more often! /s When I was last at the hospital (2 months ago), the docs increased my Latuda from 60 mg to 80 mg. I immediately started experiencing nausea as soon as I took it, so my nurse gave me that minty Maalox stuff that you drink out of a little cup. They said that my body would adjust to the higher dose and to just give it some time. 

Well, the nausea didn’t go away, and I’ve thrown up my meds twice (last night was the second time) and experienced nausea and/or stomach pain every day or almost every day. They said to take it with food, and I did, but it didn’t make a difference.

I also got a phone charger that lights up for Christmas, and its brightness was preventing me from getting good sleep. I thought I could put it as far away from my bed as possible and not have it affect me, but it was still too bright. 

Throwing up meds + ? days of unrestful sleep due to too much light from the charger = waking up at 4am and completing 5 of my Chinese lessons, restlessly pacing the house for an hour straight and then doing 200 crunches nonstop. Mind you, I am someone who barely exercises so this was pretty out of character for me! My parents were concerned at first but then we all joked around about how I’d get a 6 pack and I should start my own fitness plan (manic state recommended but not required ??). I admire them a lot for their strength and composure in situations like these. 

Feeling restless and like you can’t sit still even for a moment without screaming is pretty uncomfortable, but at least I was able to get that energy out in a positive and productive way. I ended up getting in 5000 steps this morning, so that’s pretty good! Only another 5000 to go :) 

So, I’m going to put the charger in a different room (even though I don’t want to because it’s really cute :’( ) and talk to my psychiatrist about lowering my Latuda so I don’t have as many stomach-related side effects. I also need to make a commitment to myself to exercise on a more regular basis. I was going to the gym every day for a few days but then I got sick and couldn’t do anything for almost a week. I’m feeling better now so I’m going to get back on the bandwagon.

This all started last year when I started to feel really sad and depressed but here was no reason for it and then after six months I wouldn't feel it at all. I would feel like I'm on top of everything and I was doing really well in school. And now it kind of feels like it's happening again. But slowly creeping in on me. Like my grades are going down, I sleep more. I have become way more self-destructive and impulsive when it comes to my friendships and I can be just sitting at my computer looking at stuff and feeling content and instantly just go to sadness and pointlessness and the only way I feel like I can get rid of this is to go to sleep. Because when I wake up it's like my mood resets and I try to keep myself busy from my thoughts because they get really deep and depressive really fast.

613;bipolarreddit;HardTimePickingName;08/02/2018;"roommate possible BP with Manic episodes? Long Story short, good friend of mine we were friends/roommates for 4 years on and off while we were in different states. He always seemed san while like everyone had his bugs. During few weeks when he used quiet a bit of LSD, some DMT he changed...
First couple days he was hyped up with some grandiose ideas.....from whats you would explain with ambitions up to thinking can control internet, has allergy for wifi and stuff like that.... After couple days of bad sleep, some weed it would get worse and come back again. At some point he would come up to me (fell asleep at tv) as says you and your dog have to go.... and one time i was able to explain him thats is was delusion... Another time he became violent and almost attacked me with a knife which is another story. 
It seemed to calm down after that and even he acknowledged the irrationality of his behavior. 
Today i was on the edge. He txted me and asked whether i saw hi wallet? Is looking in kitchen, replied - no, not here. To which he demanded that i look better and then said that i should go for a walk and find his wallet. I was tired of this shit and started getting dog for a walk, and putting shoes on. He became violent saying everything here is his and shit like that. Started grabbing dog, who started to bite him, to which he went manic saying - see he bites me, ill sue you for 1 mil $$ and again tries to take my shit away. I fought him off and went for a walk with dog, he followed me and started grabbing, attacking me to take my dog or what not. At that point we were 500 yards from house on street... he was saying like stop resisting you know what im capable off, there are cars driving beside - somebody can die.... at that point a moto -cop drove by and stopped, long story short they let us go. I didn't try to press charges.... but what can i do? Lately his sleep is better, but in 1 minute there can be a change in mood, and sometimes with delusional thought and all kind of stuff going on. I myself have been sleep depraved last 14 days... trying to manage my life... and his.... and im not a nanny. 
 I can't move out for another month or two? He himself doesn't have family here in states, but basically isn't self sustainable and im afraid of him being so unstable....


Anything i can do? Do you think it sounds like he could be BP?  Im thinking of contacting his parents for any advice... but as i said they are overseas.

614;bipolarreddit;HaRsh_MeLL0W;05/02/2018;"Hypomanic phases+hypersexuality=social suicide *disclaimer: I understand that this post is insanely long but I feel condensing it will dilute its message. Some of this is unrelated to my bipolar II but it still plays a central role in my issue so I felt this would be the best place to post this (plus I don't know where else to post). Little new here. I've been suffering from the symptoms of bipolar II along with social anxiety since my early teens so throughout middle/high school it crippled me socially. My rapid, awkward, all-over-the-place speech in my hypomanic phases and my mumbly, confused speech in depressive phases (if I even spoke at all) along with anxiety kept me from really connecting with anyone and i was never able (and still am not very able) to display my true self, something that crushes/depresses me to this day. It also SERIOUSLY held me back academically/athletically. I was a straight-A student with a promising competitive swimming career up until around 9th grade when my disorder had grown to an unmanageable level due to it going untreated, and it continued to for the rest of high school, with my relatively strict parents calling it bullshit at every turn and never getting me in any counseling or put on any meds until i dropped out of college at 18. Only then did they listen and see an issue. Knowing that I never realized my potential in any area of my life sends me flying into bouts of extreme depressive episodes in which I cry over what could have been and it can last days. I only thought I had depression at this point so I was misdiagnosed for another year. Now at 20 I am finally diagnosed properly and on a mood stablizier although it hasn't been particulary effective, and smoking weed and dropping acid probably doesn't help matters. But I must admit that my first couple trips allowed me to take inventory and understand that I've been bouncing between manic/depressive phases since childhood and that my issue quite possibly extends into sex addiction/hypersexuality. And it brought certain behaviors and memories to the surface that I wasn't willing to face and it's a big reason why I'm even here posting this (I DO NOT condone the use of LSD, especially for the people on this subreddit). Now we get to the main point that the title addresses (not sure if I had to give ya'll my life story first).Throughout my adolescent life a common theme has been my complete and utter lack of control of my sexual impulses, resulting in shameful behavior that I keep buried away from many: public masturbation. At the beach with a towel over me, in the nearest public bathroom and even IN CLASS. I knew it was disgusting as I was doing it, but simply HAD to get off constantly like some nympho. I could only dart to the bathroom throughout the day so many times (our monthly hall passes gave us a limited number of times to leave class). After reflecting, I feel that this urge was aggravated by a combination of my hypomanic phases (which involves being too horny) and my hypersexuality, bringing my sex drive to an INSANE level. If this is the case, then it would explain that behavior. It doesn't justify it, but it gives insight into how this happened. And teachers did NOTHING to address it. Unless the kid's autistic, I would have confronted me about it if I were in their shoes and it may have gotten me the help I needed sooner. Because they turned a blind eye, it continued to fester and get worse. I understand that it's not their job to counsel me but such extreme behavior warrants attention, I was very sick and nobody helped me. There is one exception, in which we were watching a movie in class a year after I discontinued my in-class meat-beating. A risque scene comes on, and my teacher promply says, ""Ok, settle down, John."" to which the class erupts into the most intense laughter I've ever heard that rings in my ears to this day. So if anything they made it worse. I quickly became known as that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class, bc, well.... I WAS that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class. I never stared at some chick's ass to set it off, mind you, if anything I blocked out the world to focus on my animalistic impulses. So if anyone wants to call me a gross creep, save it bc I'm already aware :( But this realization that it may not have been my fault, that I'm not a complete pervert really makes me feel better and could bring me at peace but I feel I cannot confirm it without getting some outside opinions and I don't want to go to anyone else (friends, family, etc.) other than my psychiatrist bc I'm so shameful of it and I fear they would look at me different for the rest of my life. I've just been hurting for such a long time and I'm desperate to get answers about this bc I'm too hung up on it and I likely will continue to be until I come to peace with it.

I was previously on 50mg seroquel, and 100mg lamictal, and since finding out I was pregnant, I had to drop the seroquel, but stayed on lamictal and actually bumped up to 200mg because I was not fairing well without the seroquel. I'm in therapy once a week and I see my psychiatric nurse once a month. My OB is okay with me taking lamictal I'd it is helping me, which was a relief as I was scared I was going to fave judgement and have to advocate hard for myself. 

Anyways, where I am at now is that I'm struggling to sleep more than 4 or 5 hours at a time. I'm craving coffee again, I want a pack of cigarettes, my driving habits are slipping into unsafe behaviors, and I'm picking fights and arguments...all which are my known mania symptoms. I'm sure there are more I'm just unaware of, and I've suspected an episode was coming on as soon as my sleep became troublesome, though I wanted to brush that off as 2nd trimester energy boosts, but it's clearly more than that. 

My therapist gave me a whole packet of stuff to help me calm my senses, and not agitate myself more, which I guess will be helpful, but I'm so, so, so scared. I'm not going to give in to the symptoms if I can help it, I'm definitely not going to pick up smoking again and will actively remove myself from the temptation, but I'm just so worried because this could go so many different ways and I feel more like a fish out of water than I've ever felt in my life. 

I guess I just needed to vent a little, but also, are there any moms here who have experienced pregnancy with their bipolar disorder? What did you experience while pregnant? What about post partum?

Since November I have spent almost every moment outside of class and work in my room. I stopped reaching out to friends and would just lay in my bed trying to drown my life out with movies. I’d go to bed at 7pm every night and just wake up early just so I had more time awake to lay in bed and do nothing. I was doing great at work and finished my semester strong but it took the life out of me basically. 

New Years Eve I finally decided to go out with friends after not drinking since October. (I wasn’t drinking on purpose because of my depressed mood). I didn’t over do it but I was definitely drunk and didn’t get home til 4am. 

The next morning I woke up around 11 and it was like a switch was flipped. Instead of wanting to be sedentary in my room all day I suddenly couldn’t sit still and had motivation and energy. That night I couldn’t get to sleep until after 3am and had racing thoughts all night. I didn’t feel terrible though thankfully, just restless. 

This isn’t my first rodeo so I picked up the signs that I’m going into an up swing and notified my doctor and preemptively took an extra dose of my antipsychotic (I’m allowed to add doses as needed) and took a small dose of Ativan (.25mg). 

Today i haven’t taken any extra doses but man do I feel incredible. Not out of control though by any means. I won’t let it get that far. But I went months living like an empty shell and now I feel a fire in my soul.

I was inspired by a severe manic episode my dad just experienced in December, and also by my own diagnosis of Bipolar 2. Essentially, I want to create a product that will maintain routine, promote stability, and possibly warn the user and their support group when intervention might be necessary. 
I’ve been looking at wearable technology like Fitbit and smart watches, and also at mental wellness apps that track mood, sleep, etc. I’m moving towards creating a series of products, one wearable, one stationary light/clock/pill dispenser, and also an app.

So, I have some questions!
Do you use any apps/technology to maintain routine or track your wellbeing? (Sleep, medication reminders, mood logs) Do you use it regularly? Why or why not? 
What is your daily routine around taking your medication?
While manic or depressed, how would you react to technology advising you to reach out to family, your therapist, or you psychiatrist? How would you feel if it alerted them directly? 
What is the most friendly way you could be reminded to take medication, maintain a sleep schedule, or reach out for help without feeling chastised?

Any other comments and ideas would be much appreciated! Thank you!

My bf has Bipolar type one and for a long time he was on ... mirtazopine? He was taking it for years. Back then, they said that he was scitzo affect. Last summer, he had a manic break, I had to hospitalize him and he was finally diagnosed with Bipolar type one. They then took him off that and put him on abilify and Klonopin. The abilify was giving him akathasia so they gave him the klonopin. After a while, as all mental health people seem to do, is he went off his medication. This apparently by the doc was ok. Since hes type one, if he leads a healthy lifestyle, he wont get manic again and wouldnt need an anti psychotic. Great. Thats what he wanted anyways. So after a while after being off medications, he get a ringing in his ears. Apparently this is a somewhat common side affect. He figured if he could just tough it out, his brain would fix itself.


He stayed off EVERYTHING for 4 months apart from his blood pressure meds, but he finally broke and became upset, suicidal and started drinking. He then took a Klonopin and it made the T's go away. Looking into it, its a Glutamate inhibitor to level out with his Gaba.

This would then make me think ""maybe hes addicted to Klonopin"", but he goes off it for months and then breaks down to take more again. 2mg makes it go away completely, and .5 makes in bearable. I feel so lost. He now wants to seek medically asisted euthenasia and refuses to go see the psychiatrist because he thinks they caused his T's.

626;bipolarreddit;HEM1987;01/02/2019;"Am I bipolar? tldr; got a diagnosis for bipolar as I was incredibly agitated and restless after a bad reaction to some medication and hospitalized as a manic episode. However I didn't feel elated and I was lucid. Is this bipolar or should I get a second opinion. I'm 31 years old and male.

Apologies for the essay.

Basically my story starts when I was very depressed and anxious for most of my adult life, and medication and therapy didn't do anything to really help. I tried Zoloft one day after the recommendation of my Dr. I woke up in the middle of the night all the time in a panic and couldn't think straight and after a week I was so restless I had to go to hospital. The attending Dr at the hospital said that it is a common reaction to medication if you're bipolar, and prescribed me Olanzapine.

After 2 months I hated the medication as it made me so sleepy and gain weight. So I decided to stop as I didn't need this before for 31 years. I was also prescribed Klonopin. I stopped Olanzapine and became very restless but I could deal with it with the Klonopin and I took it for 2 weeks. I remember the first day I stopped and I felt amazing though, like fully focused and full of positive energy to do things. However, one day I forgot to take Klonopin and it was like a switch flicked in my brain. I spent the next month waking up in the middle of the night in panic, feeling super restless in the morning and struggling to focus on anything.

I came off the Klonopin after that bad experience (but slowly tapered, I learned my lesson from the Olanzapine not to come of medication too quickly). I also got some Trazadone for sleep since I couldn't sleep for the whole night and would wake up in a panic and also couldn't get back to sleep despite feeling tired. As time went on, over the course of 3 months, I stopped having the panic attacks in the night, but would wake up super early really restless but exhausted. I also started to have depersonalization and had this spaced out feeling a lot of the time, and I would sort of feel like I was looked at myself in the third person. This carried on and didn't get better with time over the course of a few months.

Around thanksgiving I got really drunk, and after then, the restlessness became unbearable. I was also super emotional and couldn't focus. But I was fully aware of everything, and I didn't do anything reckless, and I didn't feel elated or anything. I basically tried to stick it out but couldn't take it, and went to hospital and they put me in a psychiatric ward as I was so agitated and restless and it was then they told me they thought I was bipolar and put me on Olanzapine again.

I've stuck it out for a few months, and to be fair, after two weeks of taking Olanzapine and Depakote, I started to feel much less restless and I was able to sleep fully. Also, the spaced out feeling subsided and started to feel myself again. However, the medication has left me super sleepy and it's affecting my work. With my psychiatrist's help we're going to lower the medication dose, but after that reduction, I'm feeling a bit spaced out, but less so than I was before. I'm still super sleepy though.

Basically I don't know what the hell is wrong with me and I kind of feel like I've been put in a bipolar box in terms of a diagnosis, but when I look at classic bipolar behavior, I don't really see it in myself? Has anyone else experienced anything like me? Like severe agitation, inability to sleep and depersonalization, but also being lucid, not engaging in reckless behavior and not having an elated mood?

Also that was a massive post, so thanks if you read it :)";2888;115;529;60;43;969;255;702

Lately I’ve been like one possessed to write direct and shoot a film myself. I have experience in none of these things whatsoever I’m a psychology major, I’ve been listening to as much new music as possible to try to be inspired and be able to have an adequate soundtrack, I’ve decided that I need to completely overhaul my life. I need to read more, write more, be around people more which means quitting my usually very isolating job in order to gain material for my screenplay. I even went as far as to drive 30 minutes to to look for a homeless man that I met two weeks prior outside a bar because I had an interesting conversation with him about Arthur C Clarke . And as far as my screenplay goes I’m obsessed I think about it constantly but I can’t think of a plot or characters or setting my mind just goes around in circles and runs into walls but it’s very important that I get it done. I started bidding on film equipment on eBay. I spent an hour crying in my car yesterday because I miss my friends and none of them are available to see me and I feel isolated.

Shyness goes, the right words and gestures are suddenly there, the power to captivate others a felt certainty. There are interests found in uninteresting people. Sensuality is pervasive and the desire to seduce and be seduced irresistible. Feelings of ease, intensity, power, well-being, financial omnipotence, and euphoria pervade one's marrow. But, somewhere, this changes. The fast ideas are far too fast, and there are far too many; overwhelming confusion replaces clarity. Memory goes. Humor and absorption on friends' faces are replaced by fear and concern.

635;bipolarreddit;hipaa-shrink;09/01/2018;"How do you contact your p-doc outside of appointments? Hey all, posting under alt throwaway for reasons.

I recently had a pdoc retire which meant dealing with the lovely process of finding a new one. It took months and was all around bad. So I finally started seeing this new doc and things are looking better...

Except last week I started getting some side effects from a meds tweak we had agreed on. I wanted to register my experiences with the doctor before they got lost to my utterly fractured memory.

Let me note that over the past decade-plus I have worked with six other pdocs and every single one of them offered two direct contact channels *at least* - a private voicemail box and a private email. They have all been clear that answers were not guaranteed let alone timely, and emergencies always go to 911. Most had a list of on-call staff you could talk to within minutes.

Biggest thing for me is the privacy. Legal implications aside, **I don't want ANYONE reading/listening to the stuff I disclose to my pdoc.**

So here's the kicker. New doc gave me his contact card at initial appointment; so far so good. Dumbass me loses the card. Call receptionist to ask doctor to get in touch, either via email or phone.

I was told that the receptionist is the ""best"" person to email and straight up didn't get an answer to the phone question. Not even a ""we can have the doctor call you when they get a chance.""

On top of this a ton of people are telling me this is MY broken expectations and doctors never give out contact info.

I am so confused, frustrated, angry, and generally miserable about this... And the original side effects are getting worse.

Is my experience really that weird? Or do these people just not have a clue?

Someone tell me I'm not crazy! (Ok, that would be a lie.)";1411;57;247;23;33;451;204;334
636;bipolarreddit;hippiefish89;26/03/2018;"ADD Inattentive and BiPolar II ... anyone else? Hi there, 
I am 30 yo female who was diagnosed as ADD Inattentive in Highschool, prescribed all those study candies and made it through college (where I began binge drinking and smoking pot)... also had a bout of serious depression and started Lexapro, which lasted only about two years . I am very petite and was taking high doses of Vyvanse (70mg) and also Adderall (30mg tab) for studying. I had what I would call my first “episode” in college after smoking a bowl... fast forward to five years out of college and still taking Adderall and vyvanse and ambien, gained about 40lbs. I wanted off of that shit so I quit taking it and quit seeing my doc. When I didn’t have any left since I stopped seeing the doc, I became addicted to Benadryl (3 at night) just to sleep. 

Anyway, I went on a trip and got some pot candy, and I got sick and then I was prescribed a 10 mg prednisone. That’s when the mania started, it was full blown mania for about 10 days, before I went to the hospital. I don’t remember everything but I was signing everything! I couldn’t stop, it was weird. 

Anyway sorry for the long post, my new doc has me on Seraquel 200mg and vistiril along with a bunch of supplements (I am trying to get away from big pharma). My problem is now I am still very distracted due to the inattentive ADD, during work I don’t work and I’ll pick at split ends or google stuff that’s irrelevant. My new doc said NO to stimulants and even said I should not drink coffee. He also said I can do pot or alcohol but it is dis-inhibiting, so basically watch out. Now I am in a depressed state, and I should be happy. 

My question to others is how do you deal with bipolar and inattentive add? It’s a tough combo but I am trying to take things one day at a time. ";1403;51;273;21;26;459;195;354

638;bipolarreddit;HipsterBran;13/03/2018;"Boyfriend [26m] diagnosed bipolar when he was 10 but I’m wary of his initial diagnosis. He’s going to go see someone to get re-evaluated as soon as he gets insurance. TW: Suicide The more I talk to my boyfriend about his past, it seems like he was demonized for having any emotions as a child and his parents were emotionally abusive and neglectful. He acted out in elementary school and attempted suicide and was sent to a psych ward where he was diagnosed. They’re not going to see that his parents were trash and used religion to mentally abuse him and shammed him for having normal human emotions/responses to their behavior. 


In the year that I’ve known him, he’s been severely depressed with racing thoughts. He’s like your typical person with severe major depression. He has thoughts of suicide almost constantly. He claims he felt normal when he moved out of his house and he’s gotten worse since being back home. Can you go an entire year or two without mania with bipolar and only have depression? His description of mania is so hard to understand that I’m unsure if that’s just his “normal” mood of being pulled out of the depression or if it’s truly mania that he’s describing. He said a happy event will trigger it and it might last 1-2 days. He also has anger issues with the depression. I know depression can make you agitated and so can mania. 


Can you have bipolar and not have manic episodes hardly ever? Like be depressed for a whole year with no indication of mania or hypomania? I’m not certain how to identify mixed episodes but he’s always depressed. 


I know he needs to go to a psychiatrist for an evaluation and treatment, but it’s not an option at this exact moment due to financial issues, so I’m just trying to learn all that I can for right now. I’m trying to get the money to take him as soon as I can. I just want to learn more about this stuff and more about him in the meantime. ";1527;60;277;32;27;504;181;370

About a month ago I was diagnosed bipolar. (Doc didn't specify what type) Now I've heard this before but since the meds never worked, it couldn't have been true, right? Wrong. New doc insisted I keep changing drugs until I found one, and, I did. BAM! Smacked in the face with reality. Coinciding with some late bills and my husband seeing that I had maxed out a 5k credit card in 2yrs, frankly, it became the week from hell.

I've been depressed all my life and I've been on pristiq for years. My earliest memory is sobbing alone on the swing set at 3yrs old bc the Puff the Magic Dragon song just made me so sad. I never made the connection when my grandmother said my uncle's were manic depressive. My mother clearly is too and my mom would argue that my grandmother is a hypocondriact. Beyond that, my mother is a person who should have never had kids. I was up for adoption but she changed her mind last min. (Bad idea) My childhood was badly bizarre to say the least.

The above matters because I *never* wanted to be like my mother. Selfish. Reckless. Embarrassing. I made it my life mission to be kind, polite and ""together"", someone dependable. But I now realize that I too am a terrible, horrible person. I've been married 15yrs and he's no saint, but I don't know how my husband has put up with me?
- Sudden remodeling projects I'd do while he was at work.
- Minimalism now! or Collect all the things!
- Thinking I can suddenly learn new careers &amp; then land a job immediately.
- Suggesting I off myself bc I bought too much cereal at the store and that alone is gonna throw us in bankruptcy surely. 

So here I am. Having a bad week at work. Wondering if my anger at other people's actions is warranted or if they notice my moods. Not trusting anything I think. Wondering when the Lamictal will start working and wondering, at what point will it become too much?

Any guidance you can suggest, if you've felt like this, is most appreciated. I don't know who I am or what I'm doing now. I'm embarrassed of my past and current self.";1642;63;310;33;45;540;235;404

The whole reason i’m booking an appt with a qualified professional tmrw is so I am able to get Dxd. This is more of a vent post/ Can anyone tell me about their experiences with mania and the journey to a DX I guess. Anyways loooong post under this paragraph. I’m on mobile so i apologize for any mistakes.

I suspect i have bipolar. My friends suspect i have bipolar. When I first went to a therapist for devoloping issues after I made a very stressful move at 18 and was really struggling, she was the first to suspect Bipolar and pushed me to to see a psych. She suspected bipolar due to very impulsive behaviors (sexual and dangerous) and hallucinations that happened while I smoked. Unfortunately I didn’t see a psych for a long time.

Who really knows but i would like for this at least to be considered bc i had a hell of a time last summer and i’m probably gearing up for another hell summer if i don’t get something straight. I in no way am qualified to diagnose myself of course, and this is mostly so I can get my facts straight to tell the doctor.

Last summer starting around march, my mood really picked up and i was having delusions, paranoia, psychosis all that good stuff. Maybe it was the weed maybe it was something else. I at one point believed the owner of someone i was dogsitting for was secretly filming me from a camera in her bed and her tv. I thought every police man was out to get me. I felt watched all the time. For a straight month I only ate stale kid sized bags of smart popcorn from my trunk and this was before i got kicked out of my house. I never slept more than 2 hours. I got kicked out of my house for smoking weed constanly even though i promised I wouldn’t do it again. I drove like a manic, In talking going 100 down I95N (any baltimorians here?? y’all hit essex and the highway gets all twisty the adrenaline rush was insane) At the time was in the middle of a ED relapse and just didn’t give a fuck I mean i was planning to buy a dog a car an apartment with absolutely no money. Shit me and the friend i was living with had elaborate plans to start a dog grooming business. I quit my job suddenly one night for no real reason and once spent an entire 7 hours filling out loans. In september I bought a car with a loan that hand a ridiculous interest rate and smashed it into a exit sign a week later bc my phone died and i was agitated and “got bored” I have no idea what this was but thank god im alive bc i totally smashed my car to bits. I was wearing my seatbelt and I joke i’m a walking seatbelt ad.

At the time I had been on Lexapro for about two weeks after seeing a psych and expressing the issues that were going on which she said sounded like anxiety and depression. The doctors in the hospital told me it was anxiety and depression. Maybe it is. I would just like some answers. I was in the hospital for six weeks, where they tried out Lexapro again and after I had adverse reactions (extreme irrabilty, impulsiveness) they switched me to Prozac and Risperdol and Dx’d me with BPD and let me go. My aunt had BPD but i also have a family history of undiagnosed disorders that caused extreme psychosis, my grandfather used to hear voices and suffered mood swings, but he was black and this was the 60s black people didn’t go to the doctor for shit like that they either drank it away or went to church. When i got out i spent 1500 dollars i didn’t have on random shit including three tattoos and completly fucked up my credit. I was medicated with a low dose of Prozac (20 mg) and Risperdol (.1mg) at the time. Three weeks later i was so depressed i did nothing but sleep and not eat. I lost ten pounds. They admitted me to the hospital for my ED about a month after I got out of my first hospitalization for the car crash. The psych there said a BPD dx didn’t make sense coming from someone who had only known me for abt four weeks and pulled it off my record. She put me on prozac and seroquel but didn’t give me a bipolar dx just left it as historical. I was doing okay and moved in with my Aunt in Texas and had about two weeks where i went off the seroquel bc i couldn’t get it refilled. I stopped sleeping again and was just generally euphoric. Nothing too crazy I was just very happy and excited and never sleeping and playing sims like a maniac. I stopped taking my seroquel after I got it refilled bc I didn’t like the feeling of forced sleep. Stopped taking my prozac too cause i just don’t give a fuck lol. Now i’ve been off my meds for about a month and a half and I’ve been okay, very impulsive and hyper sexual, making questionable decisions (quitting a new job I had for about a week, becoming a Cam girl, hopping on tinder) but still sleeping. I wanna go back on my meds but I know that after being off seroquel this long I have to wean up to the dose I was on (300mgs) cause there’s no way I can just start at that high again. Anyways anyone else just experience wild ass shit before they got a DX?? Even if i’m not bipolar I really don’t want a repeat of last summer lol.

TLDR: I’m trying to go back on my meds and get a DX from a doctor. Had a wild ass summer/fall last year and just generally did not have a good time. Anyone else have trouble with multiple DXs before they settled on one?";4241;151;857;67;85;1383;422;1077

652;bipolarreddit;Hyper1012;17/03/2018;"Abilify is scaring me So recently I was 'diagnosed' by a psychiatrist.  I see a psychologist these days, we really just talk about things and I don't find that particularly helpful.  I swing between horrible depression and even worse panic attacks/spells of psychosis.  I used to drink to 'level' myself out but in the past 4 years that really hasn't helped things and just made the psychosis worse.  Also my current gf has a flat 'no drinking' policy.

Anyway after 6 months being on the waiting list at the ONLY place my GP would refer me too, I was given a 1 hour assessment and a script for abilify.  I have a long, LONG history of eating disorders along with the alcohol abuse.  This past 13 months I have gone from being a happy 78kg (I'm 6ft 2) to a huge 115Kg because I don't have my crutch of alcohol anymore.

I'm scared of abilify.  I just took my first dose.  I'm terrified of the weight gain.  When I was 16 I was put on seroquel and I blew up like a baloon which STARTED my crippling ED bullshit.  I told all this to my psych and he assured me that Abilify was 'completely side effect free' and 'weight neutral' but my pharmacist was flabbergasted and told me I could expect a similar trail to Seroquel?

So toss the meds and get a second opinion?  Or is it not as scary as all that?  Can anyone tell me they've had ANY positive experiences with atypical antipsychotics? ";1082;44;202;28;21;364;165;266

655;bipolarreddit;iamcarltonwhitfield;12/03/2019;"Lithium covering depression? I took some time off from my therapist (6 months) but found myself having a hard time again so I went back.

I’ve been on lithium for 7 years and it saved my life. Before then, 15 years of intense suicidality. Lithium raised me out of it and I haven’t had a depressive episode like I used to in at least 5 years. I’ve struggled with hypomania, but honestly it’s just too much of a good thing. I’m pretty happy and stable, comparatively.

But now I’ve got dysphoria - I feel hugely fat, but I’m 6 feet tall and I weigh 145lbs. No sex drive at all. A lot of dissociation. 

My therapist thinks I might have depression but it doesn’t feel like that because I’m used to being really sad and suicidal when I’m depressed. She thinks maybe lithium is masking those symptoms, so it’s coming out in other ways. 

She also thinks I’ve been on lithium too long. I am very sensitive to meds, had horrible experiences on a lot of other drugs. I really don’t want to change meds. So I’m wondering if any of you have experienced anything like this, and what you did.

Thanks in advance.";863;32;172;20;21;291;128;217

Hey, I don't know if these type of questions are allowed on this subreddit, but I figured the best way to understand someone who is living with a bipolar disorder is to ask people who live with a bipolar disorder.

I met my ex-girlfriend when we were younger. We became best friends and I saved her life 2 times when she tried to commit suicide. Because of this I always thought that we have a really deep connection. However, we only started dating 3 years after knowing each other. I was 18, she was 20. We dated for 2 years and our relationship was beautiful, but also exhausting from time to time. Constant suicide thoughts because of the slightest issues, and also a shitty behaviour that she showed from time to time, including insulting, manipulating and blackmailing me. She also had depressions, social anxiety, schizophrenia and I think borderline. So it's hard to distinguish why she behaved like she did.

However, after 2 years of dating, her best friend and 2 other friends came back in her life. She suddenly lost ALL interest in me. That's what I personally think is because of borderline, since they always need 1 favourite person in life and can't have 2 at the same time.

But what really surprises me, and what can't really be explained with any of the other things, is that she really.. changed. A lot. And quickly. We always used to play videogames, watch movies, go for a walk in the park or woods. And then when her best friend came back in to her life she changed completely. She was suddenly going partying, drinking alcohol every day, she also seemed to have lost every other mental illness she had. No signs of depression anymore, no signs of social anxiety anymore. She was suddenly like one of the girls of these clichee american student movies that only drink alcohol and party and just enjoy their live without any fear of repercussions. And then she broke up. She had no sense of any guilt anymore. Cancelled a date with me to go out with another guy, broke up over whatsapp, 30 minutes later she came by with another guy to pick up her stuff. When I talked to her mother, her mother cried and told me that her daughter just said ""I have to go own my way now."" the whole time and that they (her parents) also worry about her and don't know what is happening. Apparently she also wasn't home at that point for 1 week anymore. She is also not using any social media platform anymore or is playing any video games anymore, which was basically her whole life before that.

I first thought this was because of borderline too so I asked people with borderline about it and they said that even they would never do anything like that. So my last hope, before I have to accept that she just wasn't a good human is to ask you guys. Could all of this be explained because of her bipolar disorder ?

I don’t know if this is the right subreddit, but I am hoping someone knows what I’m talking about because I’m super frustrated and I tried to ask my doctor but they don’t know the answer either. 

Basically, my partner has been on lithium the day we met, and ever since meeting them, I’ve had frequent breakouts, patches of eczema emerging and rashes all over my body.  My period has also been coming late every month since meeting them and I have ALWAYS been regular and on time. And now I’m starting to have these pinkish bumps on my face (not pimples I think.. blood would come out if I squeezed them) and their acne has also been getting a lot worse too. I’ve never had such a big reaction to anything before and I’m highly suspecting it’s their medication because I don’t know what else it could possibly be.. (we tried to switch soaps and detergents etc) They said that their previous partners never complained about any skin problems or etc but they only started lithium when they met me.

Then I had a meltdown in November because I’m so exhausted with my current job. It’s customer service and sometimes I have to handle picky clients. Started taking just klonipin to help my nerves. Ended up causing a huge fight because I took too many and felt like I could stick up for myself for once. Broke up with my boyfriend. Ended up getting back together. Things haven’t been the same since. Long story short, I recently found out that during that time we “broke up” he added was talking or trying to talk to girls on social media.  I’m normally not the person to go through peoples phones but I had a really weird feeling by the way he was acting. I’m overly jealous. It’s a flaw.  Which caused another meltdown.

(Black out drinking, klonopin, weed) I can’t sleep at night. It’s the only temporary fix that makes me happy for a moment. I did stupid shit I’m too embarrassed to even say the past couple weekends at parties. I feel super guilty too. I tried killing my self either last weekend or the weekend before. I cant even remember because I’m too mentally drained. I can’t get these thoughts out of my head. I feel guilty and I hate myself. I don’t feel bad for myself at all.

I've been struggling with mental health issues for approximately eight years now, and I am twenty-years-old. I was ""officially"" diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2016, and started an anti-depressant. It worked alright at the start, but I continually seemed to be on some sort of a wave. Sometimes it was really, really bad, but then other times it seemed like everything was fine and I couldn't remember what it was like to be depressed.

Over time, this lead to me having more questions/concerns, and I spent some time doing research, and combined with some family history, this resulted in a personal hunch that I might have some form of bipolar disorder. I was pretty convinced I might have bipolar type II.

In the past few weeks, I finally found got enrolled with a Nurse Practitioner, and I was able to talk about the crushing depression I was feeling. At first, she decided I was experiencing severe depression, and sent me for blood tests before she planned to increase my Wellbutrin prescription. However, after my blood tests and talking some more, she did further screening. Based on the questionnaires I filled out and what we talked about, she and the doctor she works under confirmed that I have bipolar disorder. Despite the fact that I had been thinking about it, it was still a shock and I'm trying to get myself oriented in this new world.

Now, about new medications... Originally, I was going to be given lamotrigine 25mg twice daily, but the nurse practitioner had to consult the doctor to figure out if I would stay on my Wellbutrin at the same time or if I needed to be weaned off Wellbutrin first. In the end, they decided to keep me on Wellbutrin, add Abilify once daily at night, and if I reached the max dose of Abilify without optimal results, then they would add lamotrigine or another mood stabilizer.

So, last week I started Abilify at the 2mg dose. I take it at approximately 11:00pm, and then go to bed. However, I am having a tough time figuring out if my symptoms over the past few days are related, if they're typical, if they're likely to last, etc.

**Disclaimer: I know that you cannot provide medical advice, nor do I want medical advice from strangers on the Internet! I will be telling my nurse practitioner everything when I see her next, which will be on Wednesday of this week. I am just hoping to find some insight from other people who have taken Abilify and had similar experiences or who can provide additional reliable resources about Abilify, because I am struggling to find this information myself.**

* The nurse practitioner told me that they wanted me on Abilify to help me get better sleep. However, I don't find it makes it easy to sleep at all. The first night, I ended up being mostly awake until 7:30am, and then slept until 10:30am. The second night, I was awake until 1:45am and slept until 10:00am, and I had similar patterns the rest of the nights so far. Last night, I went to bed around 11:00pm as usual, and still was up until around 1:00am and woke up at 5:25am. I know that it takes a while for medications to really start working, but is this at all normal? This is almost worse than my sleep lately before I started it.
* I keep feeling so, so sick. The first day, I got a little bit queasy but didn't think much of it until I woke up and couldn't get out of bed at first because I felt so sick. Over the weekend, it made me so sick that I missed two shifts at work because I couldn't be bending over and lifting things up and walking around. I actually threw up once, but that was it. I did some research online and ended up making the decision to try taking gravol with it, but I know it can make me more drowsy and it's definitely causing dry mouth. I'm wondering if anyone else has taken Abilify and had this problem? Does it go away over time, and only come back when changing doses?
* Last night specifically, while I was trying to sleep, I experienced something I don't think I ever have before. I think I had some auditory hallucinations, I heard a repetitive noise, and then it was almost like people were talking despite the fact that I was alone with my boyfriend who was sleeping soundly. I've never had them before, and I don't understand where this would come from. Could it be from taking the Abilify? Or is it likely unrelated and coincidental?

It's not even that I don't like going to school - I actually love it. I like what I'm studying and I'm excited to see what I will do after graduating. However, I'm also scared that if I try hard I will find that my best isn't good enough. I'm scared that I'll never amount to anything, or that I can't handle ""normal"" life.

I feel like I can't remember anything before maybe 12, and it's concerning (I'm 20F) I have pretty much no actual memory of my childhood. I know facts about it, but I'm not sure how much of it is just based on hearing stories from my family. I don't remember being excited for my first day of school, or when my little brother was born. I barely remember any of the houses I lived in(there were a number). I don't remember what my relationships with my siblings were like, or conversations with my parents. I literally don't have almost any memories from before I was like 12/13.

The exception being of my dad. I do have some clear, distinct memories of him being an abusive asshole. I remember things being thrown at me, being called fat, being yelled at. But even these I only have a few.

I also have trouble with dates and when things happened. I have a hard time answering questions like ""when did you start this medication"", or ""when was your last dentist appointment""

I have BPII, severe ADHD, and I suspect I disassociate sometimes but haven't really discussed that with my doctor. I had a rough upbringing, and have a lot of lasting issues resulting from it.

It makes resolving these issues difficult because I don't have clear ideas of what my childhood was like. I also feel incredibly guilty and sad because my mom died when I was 14, and I don't have as clear memories of her as the rest of my family does.

I am new here and I figured I would find a chat board that I can relate to. I've been diagnosed bipolar for over 12 years as well as ADHD, PTSD, trichotillomania and social anxiety. My fiance and I just recently moved and what two friends I had turned out to only want me around because I finally got my disability and had income finally. Given that, I'm back to having no friends again in my community.  It's painfully hard for me to talk to new people as people see me as socially awkward and just not someone to fit in anywhere. With that said I was just hoping to make a friend or friends who know what my struggle is daily with these conditions.

My fiance and my dad are my friends right now, but I would like some females to hang out with and talk to. My fiance and I are getting married this year in October so I am under a lot of stress and my anxiety is really high. I don't bite much, tend to have a good sense of humor but I'm way to good at seeing through people. If someone's fake I know it pretty quickly which also keeps me isolated.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I have been diagnosed by a PCP since 2012 with MDD, GAD. In 2016, I started seeing a male PCP in the south who told me he would handle my diagnosis unless he felt I needed to see a specialist. He changed me from Celexa to a high dose of Prozac, increased my Seroquel, put me on upto 9 Xanax a day, as well as Klonpin. Diagnosed me with ADHD, and started adderall. He changed my meds a few times saying I did not need to wean off or on as they were in the same family....I ended up in ER twice. Had several Manic breakdowns/hysterical fits (i didn't consider bipolar at the time), lost time....then over christmas, he left and the other dr refused to process my xanax refill and I went through 2 weeks of withdrawal. When he returned, he apologized and said, ""I'm surprised you're here, most people don't make it through that alive without hospitalization....I stopped going outside of needed refills. In 2018, I had no insurance and my partner and I decided I would probably be okay going off meds for a bit, and use cannabis (legal here) as the previous Dr had suggested. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is when things got bad. My symptoms blew up, and I started changing (I also turned 25). I've never been an ""angry"" person, not even when I should be. All of a sudeen I couldn't make it through work. I couldnt think. My moods were changing, and I would have a week or two, and then literally not be able to do ANYTHING for weeks. The house started getting messier, I wasn't cooking or eating, canceling shifts left and right, couldn't think or read through anything....My partner started expressing conern over my need to ""at least get back on seroquel and adderall"". In august, our dog died traumatically. PTSD symptoms fllared. My partner has BPD, anxiety, and depression that is not medicated. His anxiety sending me into full panic attacks and anger. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got insurance this year, and January I requested an appointment with a PCP. She immeadiately referred me to a Psychiatrist and Psychologist. First available appointment for therapy is March 25. Med appointment with Psych not available until April 9. Doctor calls and asks for urgent appointments. psych calls and says they can make an exception and get me in on April 7, I decline as 2 days isn't enough to move my off request from work. PCP has me come in to address medicine and for ""safety checks"", mentioning inpatient options. I can't do that. It is not an option. I have laid out my sypmtoms and cited that my sister and father have Bipolar disorder. My chart says ""Bipolar 2 suspected but not formally diagnosed, depression, anxiety, adhd nos.)

&amp;#x200B;

Today I went in, telling her it seems my depression has improved marginally but my anxiety has been horrible and constant. shaking constanty, not sleeping, headaches, and picking my skin on my face and arms worse than I have in a year (i skin pick with anxiety). She ups the limotrigene literally making me take more in the office, ultimate goal of upping to 200 mg in two weeks. She puts me back on Seroquel, and then tells me she would like to take me off the adderall and wished she had not started it as she attended a conference for ""patient's in crisis"" and they expressed the need to treat Bipolar or other disorders before ADHD and adderall. Says it may be part of the anxiety. I tell her I think it is a bad idea as it is the only improvement I have had to mood, ability to get out of bed, and work- and it seems to sometimes help the anxiety probably because I can think somewhat clearly. She then tells me to come in next week, and that the psych doc may completely change my meds in two weeks, and he or she may still take me off of Adderall. Hopes the seroquel will aid in sleep, picking, and anxiety, as well as upping the limotrigine. Perscribes me nothing for the panic, constant anxiety, not even refilling the 5 mg of Lorazepam she previously would give me 5-10 at a time. To be fair, I told her it wasn't doing much of anything and I did not ask for a refill today- thinking she would perscribe SOMETHING to help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am completely overwhelmed. I have been screaming for help for months and all I have been able to get from it has been constant med changes (which I know is a thing but....), wants to take me off the only thing that is helping, and just basically having them hope I'll make it through until the med appointment, and checking weekly to see if I have killed myself or been admitted yet. The idea of going off the adderall literally crushed me. The mention of starting completely over was too much. I was literally crying and shaking the entire time I was in the appointment. I didn't ask for this. I am barely holding on. My social life is gone, I can't make any commitment by the time it comes up either from anxiety, depression, or complete exhaustion. I didn't ask for this. I can't enjoy things. I can't breathe or stop shaking. My mouth is twiching from constantly holding it in a weird position to prevent my chin from shaking. I'm falling apart and everyone see's it, but there is nothing they can do? How am I supposed to do this? Killing myself wouldn't even matter. It would make everything worse for the people already suffering from me, I'd just be another number on a statistic sheet, and other people would still go through this. I have lost 13 friends, 10 to suicide. One was a fucking psychologist.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; this process of waiting and changing meds while waiting for 3 months for psych is too much. Any help appreciated. Even just empathy or your experience. Thanks &lt;3";4461;216;793;87;80;1423;424;1054
697;bipolarreddit;intertropical;31/03/2019;"Obsession as a feature of (hypo)mania? Around 2 years ago I spent a solid month with classic hypomanic features (feelings of grandiosity, sleeping less, immense productivity, etc). 

Afterward, though, the euphoria ebbed away. Instead, I became utterly obsessed with a friend. And whenever she got remotely close to someone else, I became *utterly convinced* that I was getting abandoned, and would sometimes do crazy things to try averting it. 

It wasn't even like the catastrophising that happens when I'm anxious/depressed. I truly 100% believed that Fate Itself had ordained she was destined to leave and no amount of logical thinking could convince me otherwise. 

Basically — do you think that might have been hypomania/a mixed episode? The psych I saw said that my ""feelings of being under-appreciated"" were a feature of depression, which makes sense given my low self esteem and self-harming tendencies in that period. But I don't think I was depressed? Depressed me never has so much obsessive energy. And in fact it was when I got properly depressed and anhedonic that the obsession gradually went away.

I chose this because my Dad is diagnosed with Bipolar and i wanted to learn more. Looking at it has made me start questioning my own mind as well.

I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD-PI. However, doing research i've found that ADHD and BD can be mistaken for eachother sometimes because of similar symptoms. BD runs in my family (through my dad) and yet i'm not aware of anyone else in my family with ADHD, which is supposedly hereditary as well. 

I have also had issues with depression and self destructive tendencies for a long time. History of alcoholism and pseudo substance abuse after failing school for 3 years and a seemingly innate ability to tell myself that i will never succeed and that i do not deserve anything other than misery and seemingly becoming hellbent on proving that voice right.

However, while i do feel that i have cycles where suddenly out of nowhere i'll just get depressed and basically zombified for a period of time, I don't feel that the mania symptoms strike me at all. I do have periods where i will suddenly be very happy and everything is great, silver linings in everything and sign up for lots of different clubs or take new courses etc. But i've seen it state an increased or grandiose sense of worth, or feeling that you are good at everything, and I have never experienced that i guess.

But starting Wednesday, it morphed into something else entirely. I was up for nearly 4 days straight, wrote ~10,000, set up an investment portfolio, bought way too many CDs and audio books, and felt fine until around dinner time yesterday.

My girlfriend came over and pleaded with me to sleep. I really didn't want to, but she threatened to call the police on me if I didn't. She said I was a danger to myself. I see that now (walking through traffic, trying to juggle knives because I thought it was funny, etc.)

She had be take a bar and a half of Xanax with two tablets of unisom, and I slept for 17 hours. 

Now I feel like absolute shit. I don't wanna get out of bed. My head's throbbing. I need to shower, eat, and drink some coffee but that would mean being around people (I live in a dorm) and just the thought of it makes my skin crawl.

721;bipolarreddit;janesae;16/03/2018;"Is happiness and stability truly attainable? I am 24 years old right now. I was diagnosed bipolar type 1 in October 2016 (age 23) after a suicide attempt landed me in the hospital, so relatively speaking, this is a new diagnosis. When I got diagnosed, a lot of things about my adolescence suddenly made sense. I suspected as early as age 15 that I was bipolar, but was unable to get help for a few years. 
I have felt depressed since I was probably 9, and I started struggling with sleep/having manic episodes since I was maybe 12 or 13. 
When I was 21, I got to university and they had a counseling program. This was when medication began.
The counselor and doctor just assumed I was depressed and had anxiety, so we medicated that, which caused further problems. I eventually stopped taking the medicine (couldn’t afford it, and especially not if it was making it worse) and things went back to normal. 
So I guess that’s what I’m getting at. My normal is fairly stable. If 1 is a major depressive episode, 5 is perfectly stable, and 10 is a manic episode, I’m probably at a 3 most of the time. 
The depression is such a huge part of me that even when I’m manic af, it’s only ever a mixed episode.
When I was diagnosed bipolar, we started medicating for that, and sometimes things feel okay for a little bit, but I’ve gone through several meds and combos and almost everything makes me feel worse. I either end up somewhere on the mania/mixed episode spectrum, or I feel no different at all. 
As it is, a good cup of coffee makes me feel better than most combos I’ve tried, so I stopped taking anything, and I feel mostly fine. Just the usual 3-4 that I always am. 
But what I want to know is if it’s possible to actually end up happy. Is there a combination of drugs that will make me feel better, and I just need to keep trying? Is there something that may be more effective than just drugs? ECT, or some kind of therapy? Or will I always live a life of being a little bit depressed. 

TL;DR: fairly recently diagnosed BD1, always at least a little depressed. Is happiness in the right combo of meds, something else, or am I doomed to always be depressed?

722;bipolarreddit;JanusOf_Oz;03/01/2019;How FMT cured my Bipolar 1 Disorder (fecal microbiota transplant) Hi all. I experimented with home FMT under the guidance of my excellent psychiatrist. It was a phenomenal success. After 18 years of hell: continuous unrelenting and completely debilitating depression, interdispersed with frequent psychotic/ manic episodes. I had been hospitalised over a dozen times and had extremely low functionality. Then in November 2016 I started home FMT. No improvement for 3 months, then I experienced an exponential decrease in all my symptoms. Within 6 months I was 100% symptom free, and was so well my psychiatrist agreed to take me off all medication. That was 14 months ago and I'm still 100% symptom free. No depression in any level for 19 months, no mania for 14 months. My intense anxiety and social phobia has completely disappeared. My stress tolerance is still increasing. I am now a highly functioning completely well person. It was miraculous. There is currently a clinical trial underway in Canada headed by Dr Valerie Taylor of the Womens College Hospital trialling FMT for bipolar depression. My psychiatrist is soon to write my case study up in the Australian New Zealand journal of psychiatry and ill soon be featured in a feature length documentary. Here is a link to my story on Australian National TV. since then (June 2017) I've also been able to lose 18kgs. The weight was a side effect of the anti psychotics I was on which I am gratefully no longer on.

I always just thought that the periods between depression were just that, but she pointed out some things that I never really noticed occurring during the times that I didn’t feel depressed. like extremely high energy, not sleeping, really really obsessive behavior. I get super into one thing or another and that’s the only thing I can focus on for like a week and after that I’ve lost all interest in it. Like a while ago, I started researching how to brew better coffee. Next thing I know I’ve spent nearly a grand on coffee makers and different coffee beans and am making like 10 cups a day, it’s all I could think about. About a week later I have no interest in touching any of it and I start feeling depressed again. 
Sorry if that sounds weird, that was just an example. 

She asked me to do research on my own to see if I think that fits but I’m not sure. I figured I could talk to other people who are also diagnosed.

My husband is struggling to make it through each day and a few times sinking into suicidal thoughts. He’s overworked (understaffing problems, he’s law enforcement), doesn’t sleep for shit, has chronic pain issues and has also struggled with depression his whole life. He is in a very very dark place and it just doesn’t want to end. I do my best to help but quite often it just never seemed to be enough. Just always coming up short. 

When we first met I was going through a really dark patch in life and he was my rock. And now when he needs one I just can’t pull it together. I sank into a very dark place too. My journal entries over the last year just got deeper and deeper into the darkness. I didn’t know what to do and my eternal demon of self harm became the main urge and thought in my head every single moment of every day. 

I called my psychiatrist and told him I just didn’t think I could do this anymore, told him I’m not gonna be able to pull myself out of this one. So he put me on a med to work in tandem with my mood stabilizer. 

I’ve been on it for a few weeks now and I already feel so much better. My mood, my ability to cope and do better in many aspects of my life, handle my husband’s dark times, doing things to improve the relationship itself and my anxiety is so much lower I find myself going days without having an attack. 

But I still find myself waiting for the other shoe to drop....... I’m keeping the hope this med truly will continue to work......

This happens only when I'm laying down at night, and almost exclusively when I'm in a really bad depressive episode. I get this low humming in my ears (like when you yawn or stretch), and then it builds up really loud for a few seconds. Usually when this happens, I either have really intense hallucinogenic dreams (where sometimes I can't tell if I'm awake or asleep), or I sleepwalk, where I fully remember being conscious, but didn't feel as though I had any control or explanation for my actions. Once I ""woke up"" scrubbing change on my bathroom floor, and didn't know how long I'd been ""out"" for.

I can tell when this is going to happen because I get nauseous, and it doesn't matter if I'm sleeping on either side or on my back or stomach. It lasts what seems like a few seconds, and then I'm ""good"" for the night (i.e. after the incident I sleep through the night).

This isn't accompanied by drug or alcohol use, it just seems to happen. Again, almost exclusively when I'm in a bad depressive episode, and only at night when I'm laying in bed. I do have a small history of seizures (I was born with a brain seizure and I've had one other seizure in my life, after my first major manic episode.

What I do is who I am, I have nobody to share my life with, nobody to make working worthwhile. I want to open my own business but I need to raid my 401k to do that. I don’t see the point in having a 401k when it’s likely I will die in my sixties. But everyone thinks it’s a bad idea to use my life savings to do something that interests me. If I show people the statistics of reduced life span for bipolar and they disregard it. If I only have 25-ish years left why shouldn’t I make it the best 25 years doing something I love? Why should I get a job that is just a job with no purpose other than to buy another day.

Hell no! I can’t escape the working class playing it safe. 


If you’re wondering, this is the store I want to open; it would be called The Basement, if you think about the kids from Stranger Things and the basement they hang out in then roll that forward 5-6 years what do you have? A place with music, and books, and games all specifically tailored to what they enjoy. The store would be selling specific genre records (growing at double digits %), dystopian/speculative/sci-fi/high fantasy books; and games like D&amp;D and Magic and Catan and similar things. Stores that carry everything and try to cater to everyone struggle but boutique style stores serving specific markets do okay and can develop a solid customer base. But apparently, having done tons of market research and knowing the product and knowing the area and what sells and having worked in retail management for years are all indicators that I should do something “safe” maybe I should be a get a job as a bus driver instead.

It’s been almost a year since I was officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder &amp; my first and only manic episode. I cringe so much when I think about the time I was manic. I know I need to be nice to myself because I literally had no control over it, but I just hate the person I was for like a week. I thought I felt empathy for the first time in my life, and also thought I could read minds and was super obsessed with eye contact and the subconscious mind. Classic bipolar shit. It hurts to watch shows that depict people having manic episodes. I wish I could just erase that part of my life, which I guess I am doing to the best of my ability. Just blocking it out. Didn’t happen.
But now I’m on lithium and lamictal, which have thankfully allowed me to at least seem sane to other people, but honestly I’m lying when I say they’re making me feel all better. They’re not. Lithium fucking sucks. I have no appetite. I’m nauseous 97% of the time, and eating makes it worse. I used to have such a beautiful figure, but I’m getting so fucking skinny, my curves are going away. I tried to eat a lot two nights ago because I really want to gain a few pounds but I ended up feeling so nauseous, I just can’t do that often enough to gain weight back. And the fucking flaking. I feel so disgusting. My skin has never flaked before but my left ear now flakes so much daily. I hate it.
And probably the worst of all, it feels like my head is no longer mine. I can’t trust my thoughts or my feelings. As soon as I start to get passionate about something, I start speaking quickly, my mind races, my hands start shaking, and boom I’m hypomanic, thinking about all the weird shit I thought about during mania, making sense of things that don’t exist. I can’t even fucking explain that to anyone because none of my friends have bipolar disorder and none of them get it. So I’m just trying to act normal while my head is just being literally insane. This almost entirely defeats my ability to feel joy about anything, literally. If I’m not hypomanic, I’m just stuck in depression. I feel really alone.

In fact, it never occurred to me to think that our relationship, which would be going so well for months and the would have a sudden two week period of intensely angry fights, was the result of bipolar disorder. We had broken up about 4 times in 3 years, always for just a few days, but this time I was tired of fighting his moods. On our last day together, while doing a last sweep after packing up our apartment, he casually mentioned that his mum ""is manic."" He had never told me that before.

I was really caught off guard by the breakup -- we had just gone to a romantic dinner the night before, and his temper seemed out of nowhere, so after giving him a few days to 'cool off' tried to fix it, and that's when I found out about his new girlfriend. He was screwing her in the bed that We were still sharing at night -- Awful.

Since we split I found out he's cycled through that girlfriend and now has 3 casual ones. He's bought a car, a new computer, 2 TVs. This despite being really tight on money generally and having a bunch of new expenses since we're not splitting them anymore -- I can't think of how he could possibly be affording this besides maxing out credit cards. He's deleted all his social media, sent angry ranting texts to his friends cutting off their friendship. Right before the breakup he applied for a bunch of jobs in exotic places (he's normally sort of boring about where he'll go) and was coming up with two totally separate out-of-nowhere plans to start businesses in fields he's not skilled in. Now I'm wondering if he could be undiagnosed bipolar. It might explain the sudden promiscuity, reckless spending, maybe even the bursts of anger out of nowhere, We're in our mid 30s, so it would be late to be diagnosed.

Now that I have this thought in my head, I'm obsessed with the idea that maybe he is sick, rather than cruel, and that he might come down from his mania and want to reconcile. I could forgive everything with a genuine apology -- and obviously a promise to seek treatment. 

It's been about 3 months since we broke it off. We split our stuff, moved to seperate places, and after getting sick of getting angry texts out of he blue, I blocked his number. I'm not going to contact him, he'd have to come to me. I guess I'm not looking for redditers to armchair diagnose but wondering: do people who dump someone during a manic spell come to regret it when they've come down? I'm wondering if my hope for reconciliation is actually plausible, or if Im just grasping at straws?";2098;81;390;38;27;680;256;511

How do you feel when you see a meme or a joke with bipolar disorder being the butt of the joke? 
I saw one today and it made me sick to my stomach. Some people think it’s better to laugh about bad situations... but I don’t think I’m that type of person. 
I saw one today that said Missing Person: Mother Nature and she’s bipolar and off her meds. What made it worse was all of the hateful comments under it about people with mental illness and bipolar. 

How do you feel about it?

December was a very difficult month for me, and this subreddit became a sanctuary during some especially hard moments. So first of all - thank you to all of you. You have helped me to realize I am not alone in this.

As a sort of therapy for myself, I shared a video of my recent challenges on Facebook. I felt completely vulnerable and almost removed it. But then responses of love and encouragement began pouring in. It was empowering and brought me a sense of hope I haven't had in a while.

People from all parts of my life began private messaging me, sharing their own stories of mental health challenges.

I realized that talking openly about my challenges is very helpful to me in the start of the journey to management. I invite you to [hear my story](https://www.facebook.com/tommygeoco/posts/10212173351023813?pnref=story) and share your own story in the comments below. 

What kind of challenges are you currently facing? How far have you come? What are you suffering from right now?

I begin a DBT partial in-patient program on January 16th, and I'm trying to make it through every day leading up to that date.

Thank you again for everything this subreddit has provided in allowing me to pursue self-love and a sense of peace. It's a long road, I'm told, but today I feel present and capable.

744;bipolarreddit;JonasMMA;29/01/2019;"A story going from manic to depressive Bipolar II explained 

My eyes open. WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE. Why was I so down yesterday? Maybe I should go to the gym. No, no: maybe I should get some work done. Yes work, I’ve been neglecting work. Actually maybe I should pay rent, I’m a couple of days overdue. I put on my favourite song. What a great fucking song, my auditory cortex shoots out musical notes like buckets of cum for my vagina of a cerebral cortex to process and enjoy. 
   
First I need to make breakfast. What’s the most optimal amount of nutrients I can make in a meal for my body weight? I research this for a couple of hours; I want to know anything and everything about how nutrients work from the macro to the micro level. I order an organic chemistry book. I order a vegetable juicer. I order 5 different multivitamins and 2 fish oils. I go for a run, planning my ultimate breakfast. I am so excited. I get a few hours of work done, life is so fucking great. Hell, maybe I’ll even find a girlfriend soon. 

Maybe I can share this with my friends. I haven’t spoken to them in a while, but I think it would be really great to catch up. So I plan 3 coffee dates for tomorrow. Perfect, that will scratch my social itch. I also want to get REALLY fucking high. Or maybe I’m just craving affection. Peaking on MDMA and having my first kiss felt identical. So does the mdma comedown and breaking up. I don’t deal with relationships very well. I’m either careless or obsessive. Very rarely do I find a good fit, in fact I haven’t yet. But I’ve learned from my mistakes.

My thoughts start racing. Maybe I’ll never find someone to give this boundless love to. Maybe I’m not attractive enough. Maybe I’m too weird. Who spends 4 hours planning their breakfast? Sometimes I say things I don’t mean. Sometimes I just want people to like me. Sometimes I won’t shut up. Sometimes friends say they like me or click well with me but it doesn’t feel genuine. Are all my relationships fake? I’m definitely overthinking this. This can’t be true.

 My dad comes into my room and asks how applying to work is going, I tell him to fuck off. I can’t believe I just said that. I’m just mentally fucked up and waiting for my meds to work, this must be the case. My friends like me, right? I need to slow down my thoughts, this is driving me mad. I order some ket, haven’t eaten all day and decide to order pizza. I binge and fall asleep. 

I wake up. The greyness of the bleak sky reflects through my cold window. I gather all my strength to go take a shower. I made it to the bathroom and undress. I’ve put on weight. My brutal acne medicine isn’t working as promised, in fact it’s made it worse. I’ve ignored calls from my landlord for days now, there’s no way I can call him and sort it out. I dropped out of school, I’m a fucking failure. I put on my favourite song. My auditory cortex hits me cerebral cortex with notes like harpoons to Moby Dick. What trash, how can anybody enjoy music?

Oh fuck, I have to meet up with my friends today. I try and get myself together and make a lazy breakfast. One friend calls me and says he can’t make it. I’m somewhat upset but also relieved. I meet up with my other friend. We have a seemingly normal conversation but I am fucking shattered. I can’t tell if he can tell or not. I leave the conversation feeling defeated, I’ve had so much to say and nothing but small talk left my mouth. He must think I’m boring, I despise being boring. 

I return home to find my books, vitamins and juicer waiting for me in a parcel at my doorstep. I’m never gonna use this shit, what’s the point? Ah but yes, my ket arrived, I’ll get a couple of hours of peace completely zombified. 

My dad calls me when I’m all fucked up. He can tell I’m fucked up and he’s worried I’m going to overdose. I try to pretend to be sober and he tries to pretend to believe that I’m sober as to not upset me more, it’s the saddest thing in the world. He drives me to the emergency unit and I get my vitals checked, all is seemingly fine. My parents have been nothing but supportive and I’m still like this. My phone dies and I can’t get it to work, my last friend completely ghosted and in my mind gone forever. Maybe some day I’ll get better, I’m just waiting for the meds to work. I fall asleep.

I wake up, WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE.

I was previously on Lamictal, but I got hives on my feet and elbows that started spreading. So, my psychiatrist changed me to Trileptal 300 mg morning and night. 

I was wondering, how do y'all deal with the side effects? What are the side effects you've experienced?

I know that I should be thankful that mood stabilizers are working, but I really don't know how to cope with how tired I feel. And I'm afraid of the acne side effect.

I am so uncomfortable in bed at the moment, my body just hurts. My body itself cannot rest itself.

But then whenever I’m not on this high I’m so sad and bitter and lonely all the time. I don’t wanna talk to anyone or go on social media, or get out of my bed.

I’ve noticed a huge pattern and it’s getting more and more noticeable. I’m 14 female. I do take vyvanse for ADHD which it really affects my mood when I am not on it, but even when I’m on it now it doesn’t make me happy like it used to. I’m also taking anti depressants but they haven’t done fuck all. I’m wondering if any of these might be playing a part in it? I don’t know. I feel like I don’t have anyone. I don’t have much friends, and the friends I do have aren’t my ride or die by any means, they’re just “now friends” if you know what I mean. maybe my loneliness is doing this?? Maybe bipolar???

752;bipolarreddit;jruffo;24/01/2019;"Improving Physique and Body Confidence causing onset of some mania symptoms? Hey guys, I’m a 22 yo male in college and I have been lifting 6 days a week for a while now. I would say I’m pretty built and over the last few weeks I have definitely been becoming more defined (guess that happens when the holiday season and all the food that comes with it finishes haha). My body confidence is definitely improving and my attitude in general has become better because of it. The issue is the last time I really looked good it caused me to almost have too much confidence and for someone with bipolar I feel this could be an issue. The last time I crashed there were a lot more factors involved and I have learned a lot since. I do not drink alcohol anymore and I have cut back my marijuana usage substantially. I am currently eating a normal amount of food and getting enough sleep everyday. But I’m noticing some possible signs of some type of mania coming if I’m not careful. This means I will probably have to up my meds dealing with the mania, but these meds often cause weight gain, so taking more may take away a lot of what I have worked for exercise-wise. I feel like I’m stuck in that I have to make a choice between my mental and physical health (along with my body confidence). I will obviously choose mental health if push comes to shove because I do not want to experience the same crash that I did last time, but it just feels unfair.

We've just had a beautiful baby boy, I was so lucky that I got to have almost a year off work to be with him. I had arranged to go back to work and a week before I was due back in I had a hypomanic blip, I went to the doctor's about it when I felt it coming on (they were beyond useless, seriously the NHS is in dire fucking trouble as well as anyone who desperately needs their help) they wanted me to postpone going back but financially it was just impossible, plus I felt like I could conquer the world so I went back. I was really productive and confident for about a month until the higher dose meds brought me back down and now I'm stable again.

The problem now is that I have other medical problems, I deal with a lot of pain &amp; I have epilepsy so there's trying to keep that in check too, as well as caring for my son and at this point in time, I just can't deal with it all. My concentration for anything other than playing with my son, changing him, feeding him etc is nil. When he goes to bed at night I pretty much just sit there and stare at what ever nonsense is on the TV because I don't have the brain capacity to even try to enjoy anything like a game or movie or reading or anything. I just sit there and then go to sleep. 

I have a tonne of support at home, my SO is a diamond I am so thankful for him. I really chose well in the life partner department for sure. My family, mil &amp; friends are all super supportive too. So I don't really have much to complain about outside of not coping with work. 

I used to love my job, I was good at it &amp; I love recognition for when I do a good job but I just don't think I'm good at it anymore.

I'm medicated and pretty well stable for the last 5 years. 

My job was so incredibly stressful the last few months. I was coming home every day, with no energy to cook dinner or clean, and mostly just spending my evenings watching tv and or crying. I didn't know what to do. There's an extra element of stress to a stressful job when you're bipolar, as I don't know if the job is really the problem, or if I'm going into an episode. 

My 1-up manager was away on a Friday, so I spoke to my 2-up manager and said I wasn't coping with the stress and would like to hand in my resignation. I didn't ask for any special treatment, just offered my resignation. He asked me to just think about it for the weekend and we'd discuss it again on the Monday. 

On the Monday, he brought my 1-up into the discussion. They offered me some leniencies, and said they'd figured the job might actually be a 2 person job back when they hired me, and they'd reassess the business plan and asked if I'd be happy to stay if the job was cut in half. I said I couldn't offer a commitment, but I'd be willing to try. 

At the end of that week, I heard from one of my colleagues that my 1 up had told him that I ""spat the dummy"" and ""didn't want to do the hard work anymore"". I was furious. I was humiliated. Not only was my supposedly confidential conversation with management not confidential, but it was totally changed to make me look like a whiner. 

I spoke to my partner and he agreed this was not on and that I need to get out of that place. So I took a week of stress leave (sick leave officially). During my week off sick, I received 47 (not a typo!) calls from work from people expecting me to do things and make decisions. While I was sick! 

I realised the only time I was badly stressed during that week was when I woke up and had that instant dread of thinking I had to go to work, and when I received a call. Otherwise I felt ok. I called up on the last day and resigned. 

Today is my 5th day of unemployment and I am so, so happy. I feel almost back to normal again. I still get stressed if I think about having to apply for jobs, but that's ok, because I've decided to give myself at least 6 weeks off to decompress from that stressful job before I start looking again. 

*The point of this message*: no job is worth more than your mental health. Save money! Be prepared to be unemployed for a while if you need to, because shitty jobs will come along, and you need to be able to get out. I've never in my life been so happy to have some savings, and I don't mind if I blow through it all over the next 6 months. I'm just happy to be out.";2093;67;452;30;37;701;245;555
757;bipolarreddit;judithiscari0t;03/01/2018;"I'm on klonopin but it doesn't seem to be very effective anymore... The background (which can be skipped if you'd like):

I've been on benzos for about 16 years. At one point (when I was 20-21) I was put on on Xanax 6mg/day which is obscene. I think this increased my tolerance. At the time, I was also very depressed (maybe exasperated by  the Xanax) and drinking a liter of vodka a day.

Needless to say, after a bit of homelessness and finally moving to a different state, I was slowly tapered down on Valium.  I was relatively stable in that and then was forced to move again to another state where they refused to prescribe any benzos or any adequate medications for my bipolar disorder.

I ended up staying in the house for about nine months because I was too anxious to leave. I would go to my psych appointments with no progress on getting them to put me on something that worked for the intense depression I was in. I *was* seeing a psychiatrist at the time who I really connected with and miss him but have never found another one who I don't feel is judging my life.

I quit drinking cold turkey 5 years ago and have never had any more problems with that.

However, I was then forced to move to yet *another* state where I couldn't find any psychiatric treatment whatsoever as was unmediated and in a mixed episode for over a year. I did finally get into psychiatric treatment by going inpatient and was put back on klonopin 3mg/day which I'm told is a high dose.

Then my psychiatrist suddenly died and his clinic closed. Two months later,  I got an appointment with my wonderful new psychiatrist and was back on track.  Unfortunately, the klonopin doesn't seem to have much effect on me. I've taken 10mg at once with absolutely no effect (I'm aware this is dangerous as fuck but apparently not for me).

To the current situation:

I am looking for a change. My anxiety level is very high but vaping with nicotine (I have never been an actual cigarette smoker) seems to help quite a bit but not entirely. 

With the Klonopin not doing its  job, I feel like a different benzo might be a potential answer. I don't want to be back on Xanax and Valium didn't do much either. Has anyone been in a similar situation with tolerance and successfully switched to a more effective benzo?  If so, any suggestions?";1826;78;333;50;29;607;219;437

I'm on 1200 lithium and 200 Lamictal/lamotrigine. The Lamictal has been the first thing that's worked for me, lifting (some of) my current depression.

My psychiatrist has acted like lithium is a necessary, be-all-end-all drug; but from reading here, I see that that's not the case. I don't think it has ever done anything for me (including a good 2 weeks in the hospital on lithium alone with zero improvement). Thyroid issues already run in my family, so I'm worried about that. And recently, it's also given me terrible acne. Maybe I'm vain, but I can't live with that. So I want to go off it.

Question--Is anyone on Lamictal alone? How does it work for you?

Also, I've noticed that a lot of people here seem to be on a Lamictal/Wellbutrin combo. I'm still experiencing depression (and did even prior to my dx), and I know Wellbutrin doesn't have the weight and libido problems that other antidepressants do, so I'm interested in trying that. I'm hoping it could also help with low energy from the Lamictal.

Question 2--What is this combo like? And what did doctors say about its efficacy / why it should be used? My psychiatrist is a resident in a hospital clinic so she is pretty conservative; I need a good argument.

Over the course of the past two months, I have been forced to resign from my work. I wasn't stable and did not have enough FMLA time. I broke it off with my boyfriend (I realized after four years he was mildly emotionally abusive) and I am currently cat sitting for a friend, but I have been here since mid-January. 
I feel like I have way overstayed my welcome here. I was going to go a couple of hours back to my original city and stay with a friend. I think I got confused and she got upset and felt her boundaries were broken about me staying too much. I feel like an asshole. I feel like I probably just lost a friend and I didn't mean to overstep. I let her know I meant no harm and I thanked her for her help and wished her a good night. I hate this illness. 
I am going to be flying out to my brother's on the 12th to be with his family that isn't triggering, stabilize, and get ready to come back and move in with my best friend once I find work. I have a couple of friends I am staying with a couple of days before I fly out, but for that first two days, I think I will just sleep in my car. I feel like a complete loser. I feel worthless.

A few people close to me in the past few years have gotten mentally ill. With some success they manage to get to the hospital but there is nothing that can be done if they refuse to take medications. I have a friend who’s in a psychosis state and is refusing medications. He’s not functioning and no matter how often he’s brought to the hospital he won’t take the medications so he can’t get better.

I’m wondering if you guys had any experience or any thoughts on whether being involuntarily medicated while your in a complete psychosis stat should be allowed. 

Mostly just thinking and ranting. I just wish that there was more that I could do. Because I was the same as him 5 years ago but I was able to be convinced to take my medication.

I am waiting for insurance to kick in with my new job, and unfortunately I can not afford to go to a psych in my new state until the insurance takes effect, due to moving into an apartment that isn’t affordable. 

Right now I think I’m in a manic episode. I’ve had a lot of really bad things happen in the past week or so, and for the past 4 days and nights I haven’t slept more than 4 hours total, and I cannot eat. Usually my mania is the typical delusions of grandeur, irresponsible spending, no sleep, etc, but that’s not what’s happening to me this go around. I don’t have control over my emotions and I’ve been in mental agony over the things I have going on, and the lack of sleep or ability to take care of myself have made it a lot worse. I’m not sure if this is mania, but while I do have insomnia, I still am usually able to get at least 5 hours of sleep at night. I’ve taken double doses of Benadryl, and I just ended up hallucinating and still not sleeping. 

Does anyone have any idea what might be going on, or possibly maybe some advice to help make it out of this?

I was parked correctly, already parked and I wasn't going to pull forward. The lady sat there for 4 mins waiting for me.

775;bipolarreddit;kapibarasann;14/01/2018;"New to Risperdal; do side effects subside? I'm 27 years old and was just diagnosed with bipolar type II after Prozac treating what they thought was depression sent me into a psychotic episode. I was diagnosed with major depression &amp; generalized anxiety disorder at 12 years old and just coasted on Wellbutrin XL &amp; Celexa until college, then cut back to just Wellbutrin XL in college until about a month ago. I haven't been depressed in at least a year but my anxiety has been out of control for many years. The psychiatrist at the hospital was convinced the anxiety is a manifestation of hypomania, and put me in Risperdal 0.5mg twice a day. I started it 4 days ago and take it in additional to Wellbutrin.

Anyway, enough about that. My dose of Risperdal is very low at 1mg a day and I still feel like a [metaphorical] zombie. My brain is in a fog and I can barely stay awake. I'm terrified of driving or working like this. No general anxiety, though! Thankfully, I don't notice an increase in appetite either.

If you took Risperdal, did early symptoms go away after a while? I'm just a little disturbed because it's such a low dose and I'm already feeling like this. The psychiatrist eventually wants to maybe bump me up to 2mg a day, but if that's gonna make me feel even more like this, I don't know if I'd be able to function. I'm willing to stick with it if it'll make my out-of-control anxiety manageable at some point, but I'm a bit skeptical if these side effects will continue as long as I'm on it.";1204;59;232;26;20;398;163;298

Disclaimer: Don't be stupid and go off your medication in a single day without anybody watching it like I did. This could seriously harm you, don't do it, learn from my mistakes. Also try not to lie if that's a problem for you.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 14 my mother first took me to a GP to ask for a referral to a children's psychiatrist. From there on it was a whirlwind of seeing different psychiatrists and receiving different diagnoses. 2 years later it was agreed that I had bipolar II and I was put on medication and sent to therapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how medication worked for me, I was prescribed some mood-stabilisers and I took them, and after I was asked how they work for me I said yeah, they are great, despite not feeling any difference at all. Therapy didn't help me either, I'm a self-diagnosed compulsive liar and therapy did nothing for me because I just lied to my therapist about a bunch of trivial things, so I never allowed her to get close. I think I lie mostly because I don't like people getting to know too much about me and my life, though often I also just lie for no reason at all. I'm not a sociopath or psychopath, I do experience emotions very much and sometimes I get angry at myself for lying to people I care about. 

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason, at some point when I was 17 I just could not manage to call my psychiatrist nor my therapist for another appointment. My mother, who is a supportive and kind person normally, who however always stigmatised and made fun of me for mental health issues (despite having some herself), refused to call them for me on the basis that I'm 17, I should be able to do this for myself now.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I never went back to my psychiatrist and that meant no more pharmacy recipes for my medication. That's how I uncontrolledly went off my mood-stabilisers. It was a whirlwind and it pushed me right back to the start of my problems. Don't do this. This is stupid and dangerous and not recommended by ANYBODY.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I have learned to control myself better and I have learned coping methods that help me. I still know I am going through phases of depression and hypomania and rapid-cycling. I am learning methods that help me push through it. I believe I'm at a point in my life where I have the will and drive to get help and medication again, but I try to cope. I'm turning 21 soon and currently enrolled half-time at an online university. I study in English, which is not my native language, but I enjoy it very much and it's a field I am very very interested in. I have a boyfriend who is older than me and financially supports me. I am a supportive family that I could always come back to running, if I dropped out of university it would not be the end of the world. Even though I dropped out of high school right before graduation (because I stood no chance at ever passing the math final) I could get a job and not worry about money, thanks to my family's circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I mostly suffer from the 'side effect' symptoms of BP II, (as I like to call them): delusions, emotional intensity, binging on various things and irritability. I sometimes get bouts of feelings of guilt for things that are long done with, or just for no reason. I feel highly emotional about wasting food, money, other things. Which can be a challenge when you experience hypomania sometimes, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been on 200 mg Zoloft for three years and it doesn’t seem to be helping; frankly, I don’t know if it ever did or if life circumstances were what made me feel like it did. I also have therapy but I only see her once every two weeks and I just started seeing her last month. Nonetheless, the past few months have been absolute hell. A lot of change in my life has occurred and therefore stress has followed, but some other things outside of being stressed have also added to it. 
1) I’m a special education teacher &amp; this is my first year teaching. I feel like I’m completely in over my head and like I’m not supported at work. I’m the only SPED teacher there and am constantly overlooked.
2) I moved out of my parents during the summer when I got my job here in San Diego. I absolutely love my apartment and where I live &amp; I’ve always my own space (I grew up sharing a room with my 2 sisters my whole life). While I love it and am grateful to be where I am, I’m alone every single day and don’t have friends here.
3) I’m codependent &amp; am constantly on the lookout for a man who will temporarily fill the void that my ex has left in me. This turns into having strangers come over and sharing my bed with them for the sake of feeling desired and not alone &amp; jumping into relationships that are short-lived because I’m a mess or because they move on.
4) I was drugged by someone I went on a date with who then took me back to my apartment and raped me in my bed. That was on November 6th.
5) My social anxiety at work is through the roof. I feel scrutinized all the time. I’m afraid everyone thinks I’m not good at my job and I’m only there because they were desperate for someone to take that particular class (moderate/severe disabilities).
6) I attempted suicide last month and was out of work for two weeks. They were supportive but my anxiety tells me I’m a burden. This has also caused great concern for my parents who already have to deal with my older sister (that’s a whole different story).
7) My drinking is out of hand and I feel completely lost. When I’m not drunk, I’m numb and my thoughts are too much to handle. When I am drunk, I lose control and slice up my thighs with scissors. That happened just a week ago. However, I’ve been managing my drinking since then, but I don’t know how long that’ll last.
8) Today I tied a scarf around my neck and tightened it until I couldn’t breathe just to see how it felt. Suicide ideation is constantly running through my mind. 
9) My sleep schedule is absolutely fucked. I’m either awake for 30 hours at a time or I have to sleep for an entire day.

I'm not sure even how to call it, but, for example, today I spent whole day thinking about that our world seems kinda hollow and that there's something beyond love, family and money. The reason I post it is that it feels somewhat damaging to me. I feel like I have to find the answer and I spend some time doing researches. I just don't know how to be over it and calm about it. So why it feels damaging..I have 2 outcomes: first is logical but I can't accept it, the second is irrational, I can't prove it, but it feels like it's the truth. 
I'm not sure, maybe it's something obvious and I just don't know about. Just curious if it is related to bipolar, because my friends say I just need to calm down, but I can't. If you experience it, how do you stop it or what do you do about it? Btw, I have bp2";742;25;163;14;18;249;99;198
797;bipolarreddit;kinggubz;19/01/2018;"Been Diagnosed for about three months now and had a few questions... Hi, I had a recent diagnosis of Bipolar/Manic Depressive disorder after an episode of psychosis in the summer time.

I am just a little confused on my diagnosis. You see I've been super depressed for a really long time and aside from last year (I became manic and then had psychosis) I haven't really had any up/high feelings of mood aside from again the one last year. My Psychiatrist said he's 75% certain that I have bipolar so I'll take his word for it but I'm just a little confused.

So I guess my questions are;

- Is it common to have the majority of your mood with bipolar be depression?

- Is it common to have long periods of depression with bipolar and short infrequent bouts of mania?

- When is it common to start exhibiting signs that your bipolar when you haven't been diagnosed at a young age?

Sorry if the questions are kind of stupid, I just want to start some conversations about my new found mental illness and learn some things. Thanks friends.";819;32;147;16;15;262;109;194

Hi I’m in my late teens and would like to know if I’m bipolar or not, I’m asking this because someone told me that I might be bipolar because she thought I was on a manic episode. I would also like you’re experiences of early signs of bipolar



My mood swings during seasons but it kinda has to do with my seasonal affective disorder:

-winter: feel anxious, sometimes get panick attacks, I even got depressed this year due to me loosing myself to my OCD fears
My fetishes also come at me very strongly in winter, I become hypersexual and cannot control my sexual urges which cause me distress

-Summer: I feel some sort of euphoria and well being

-Sometimes I feel very hyperactive and cannot concentrate, move my legs a lot, turn my head a lot, cannot stop laughing at jokes that aren’t even that funny and I have a very strong compulsion to fool around 



Paranoi: 

-I hallucinated a few times but they were just like rare, sometimes I hear a voice call my name but it lasts one second
When I’m anxious I tend to have more auditory hallucinations but they don’t scare me  because they last like one second.
I remember a few times when I woke up from bed I heard 10 second conversations and once heard someone say my name aggressively but they didn’t really scare me .The voices don’t really interfere with my life or anything. I remember having many hallucinations when I was little of having bee buzzing sounds that disturbed me several times but I don’t have them anymore


-Sometimes even now, I am scared in the shower and get anxious so I sometimes have a strong compulsion to see behind the curtains if someone is looking at me to reassure myself because sometimes I feel pressure.



So do you guys think I’m bipolar or not?

I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder 2 about 5 years ago. My post can be triggering to some. 


Around December I started noticing downs more often. I’ve been really stressed, and it started then. I couldn’t afford rent and medication took out some loans. Now I’m even further behind. I’ve been fighting to stay positive. It’s been really hard. Like really hard. Ive honestly thought of selling my body just to get on top.

Also, my owners of the company I work for. just recently said everyone is replaceable. I’m passionate at my job and have been there three years. To hear how unimportant I am hurt. I took it to heart. 

I feel so awkward in my own skin, so unhappy... So alone. I don’t know where to seek help. Not just from a clinic. I hate doctors and in my past they gave me lethal mixes and have killed me once. (honestly I wished I had stayed dead) 

The thought of suicide sounds better and better. They’ll find me when they evict me. So I have about 9 days to think about it. 

I’m tired of the swings, feeling alone and unimportant. Like there is nothing left of this world. Deep down no one cares. I struggle on for family(to save face) but idk if that will keep me on this plane anymore. All I do is work work work. No enjoyment from life. No ease. No partnership. Nothing other then my little kitty and a small apt... Now I’m loosing everything. What little I had is going to be gone.  I just rather be dead then continue this path. It sucks... I feel like I’m working towards nothing. I will never get on top. Life keeps punishing me. I can’t keep up this pain. Loosing everything sucks. It’s hard to find any sliver lining at this point. 

I’m tired.... 90% of me at this points wants to end it all. With death comes peace. A peace I’ve tasted before. No more rent/bills, no more feeling inadequate and alone, like I don’t belong. Im afraid I’m at the end of my road. ";1637;53;340;29;59;528;217;418

At the age of 13, I was diagnosed with ADHD, Trichotillomania, anxiety, insomnia and a binge eating disorder. I didn't seek medication until I was 18 as my family refused me any meds. In which I was placed on Adderall and Xanax. 

After 3 years, my body began to digest it differently causing constant need to have my meds adjusted until he suggested Vyvanse. Xanax never needed to be adjusted nor did I experience addictive side effects. My doctor would take me off of Xanax to see if I experienced and adverse effects. 

With Vyvanse I was able to focus, avoid binge eating all together without any issues maintaining a normal diet. My mood swings were gone, I was even able to sleep normally as once the meds wore off, I was tired and ready for bed by 9:30am

Now with my new diagnosis of Bipolar, which came apparent when mania appeared out of nowhere once I stopped taking Vyvanse when waiting for new insurance due to moving out of state, (the meds are expensive as hell at 200 bucks) 

My doctor now has me on Lamictal(100mg) for depression Seroquel(50mg) for my mania and Insomnia, and Hydroxyzine(50mg) for my anxiety. My mania and depression are gone, although these meds do nothing for my anxiety. I am still dealing with the mood swings I often experienced with adhd. I am quickly irritable or angry over the smallest things. No attention to anything..(like I stopped writing this post 3 times lmao) no motivation, and I am back to binge eating. 

I have asked my doctor to allow me back on my Vyvanse in which he has told me no until my mood stabilizes. It has and then he has told me my mania may happen with Vyvanse even tho he stated this med carries a small risk due to the way it metabolizes. I have never experienced mania during Vyvanse and I am so worried about my binge eating symptoms in which I have gained 60 pounds since last October, and my lack of attention and along with my impulse issues. 

I see my psychiatrist again today and I am wondering if I should insist that I am placed back on my adhd meds as a trial run? I have tried most non-stimulants such as Concerta which just led to me being even more exhausted than I normally am atm. 

Any advise would be appreciated &lt;3

I was put on Lithium and built up to 900(?) mg over the course of 9 days i believe (300 for 2 days, 600 for another 2, then 900 for 5 days followed by blood work after the 5th day). However, after the second day of 900 I started feeling what I believe is hypomania(?) only to feel completely cluttered and confused after a few hours, resulting in me feeling rather scared. A few days later, I gradually became more and more agitated, hostile, and on edge for the most part.

I go through moments where i feel like crying my eyes out because this whole thing feels so uncomfortable that its practically painful. The urge to cry also hits hard when I'm listening to music, which I've been doing A LOT btw. Also with music, I feel that its the only thing that calms me down somewhat. Yet it also hypes me up and makes me feel great. But that's somewhat besides the point I guess. I reached out to my doctor about this a few days ago and she wanted me to get off of the Lithium. Its been 2 days now, maybe more, and I'm not sure if Lithium was even the problem. As a matter of fact, I have no clue as to what it could be, seeing as I've never felt this way before. Yes, I have been euphorically happy and ""hypomanic"" as well as severely depressed, but I have no clue if its the Bipolar 2, or the Lithium.

She let me know beforehand that she was bipolar and gave me opportunities to not pursue a relationship with her. I really care about her so I let her know I appreciate it but that I'd really like to build something with her.

Most recently she lost her meds when I was visiting and it totally shook her. One night she started to have a manic episode (Idk what the correct term is) and she was crying and laughing and rolling around on the bed.

I tried to comfort her but honestly I had no clue what to do. She couldn't talk after a point and was texting me saying it felt like if she talked that she'd completely lose it. She needed me to leave so I left but I felt scared and awful that I couldn't do anything for her. I didn't want to leave also because I was worried about possible suicidal tendencies.

I feel like this is something I'll have to talk to her more about, but atm she isn't ready to open up about the topic, and I don't want to force the issue just yet.

I'm stuck in between wanting to give her the space she needs, and wanting to do everything I can to become the support system she needs. I don't feel her family provides her with it.

Despite having the worst depression of my life I've managed to stay interested in the things I enjoy. Recently, I've grown more and more uninterested and numb. Today I don't feel like doing anything. I stayed in bed all day I barely ate and haven't had any water. I barely want to move. I'm thinking about suicide every chance I get and breathing feels like a chore. I don't know what I'm trying to get out of posting I just needed to tell someone. I need to go to a hospital or something but I can not. This is the worst feeling ever. Knowing you need help but can't receive any and being completely alone on top of that. Honestly, my cats are keeping me going at this point. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy depression is a terrible, terrible thing. I don't think I can even talk without feeling like I'm going to cry yet I feel so numb?

828;bipolarreddit;LabraderpTrickster;26/01/2018;"Medication adjustments, I'm frustrated . 22/F, Bipolar 2. I need a rant . I'm in college. I struggled with schooling my entire life, I guess for the simple fact that things don't hold my attention or interests for long. Pair that with depression and random hypomania, anxiety and well... nothing good. I dropped out of hignschool but got my vrade 12 and now I'm trying to better myself . While I'm doing better than before due to medication, it's still a struggle. 
Back in February  2017, I made the hard choice to see my doctor and have a referal put in to see a psychiatrist . Since I live in a shitty area, we have one fly in once every so often. So when I seen him, he put me on lamotragine and said that was the issue at hand to be dealt with first, then we would see what the next point of action would be (ADHD, depression, anxiety). Since I've been doing well with anxiety, he suspected ADHD would be next and seemed to think I would be able to notice after the dose was increased a few times. 
 Fast forward to today. I'm on 150mg of lamotragine, clonazepam as needed (when I get aggressive, panic attacks etc). I was leveled out for months at 125mgs, but had a checkup for refills back in October where my family doctor increased them because the psychiatrist wanted to see about getting me up to 300mgs. Since it was what the psychiatrist wanted, family doctor wanted to keep increasing to ""see what the differance is""... I was hesitant because I'm in school, I don't want to jeopardize anything, and this dosage I was on was tried and true as far as I was concerned. After telling him how I felt he said ""your feeling good now, maybe you could be feeling better"" so... benefit of the doubt, I did as I was told. 
Yesterday I had another appointment. I went in, figuring it was the usual routine. Told him I couldn't concentrate, I was feeling distracted often and easily, and my interests were shifting pretty often so I was concerned. I asked to see the psychiatrist again to talk about ADHD since that's what was suggested before, and seems to be what I'm dealing with. I was told WE DONT HAVE ONE RIGHT NOW.... BUT would very soon and I would have a referral put in  to see him/her for when we do and they visit. Awesome, right? 
So now he wants to lower my dosage back to 125mgs to ""see the difference"" which is the same shit I was told when he increased it to 150mgs. I don't want to do that. I'm uncomfortable, possibly distressed about the thought of it altogether since I'm so sensitive to these things. I can't afford a hypomanic/depressive spiral right now, not while I'm in school... so I'm thinking I'll just keep my dosage until I see another psychiatrist....  FML";2101;80;395;48;38;696;231;516

832;bipolarreddit;ladyroyalty;09/04/2019;"Doing very well, but I feel guilty about recent events. Any advice? Hi everyone,

So I've been kicking life in the butt recently and I'm doing really well at work. I'm so proud of myself and I know that I have the energy to keep going and even push bad thoughts away.

To put the situation into context, when I was first diagnosed with BPD I took a lot of time off work sick. I then decided to leave and help myself get better. I rejoined my job back in Feb and I think I surprised myself in thriving when I went back.

So I work in a call centre and if you know what its like working in one, you'll know that diseases and sickness are a minefield. On Sunday night I came down with really bad flu and took Monday off. My team leader was fine with it as they know that this is something that's going round and tbf I sounded awful on the phone. I've also decided to take today off too as I'm not feeling much better. 

I guess I'm feeling pretty guilty about it because I've never had an absence from work since I went back. I'm feeling a little paranoid and worried that my TL might think I'm slipping back into old bad habits of staying of work. I know this is pretty trivial but it means a lot to me that I've improved so much.

Just wondering if anyone had any advice about feeling a little less guilty about it?";1032;31;210;10;21;341;143;270

843;bipolarreddit;LateActinomycetaceae;06/02/2018;"Lamictal / Pristiq / Wellbutrin - Bad Combination? Hey all -

First, I am a male in my early 20s.

I have been struggling to find the right mix of medication for me. I am not formally diagnosed with BP - my doctor classified it as depression at the beginning.

My experiences with medications began about five years ago. I originally started with small doses of Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine) and Wellbutrin (Bupropion HCL XL). 50mg of Pristiq and 150mg of Bupropion. Still didn't feel 'right' so the doses got upped over the course of a year or two. I eventually was taking 450mg of Bupropion and 200mg of Pristiq.

A year or so later, my doctor added Lamictal (Lamotrigene). Began at 50mg, went to 100mg, and eventually 200mg. At this same time, my doctor decreased my dosage of Pristiq. I was taking: 100mg Pristiq / 450 mg Bupropion / 200mg Lamictal. Lamictal seemingly helped the most out of all the drugs. I was not feeling extremely low ever (i.e. hurt myself).

Looking back it seems like a whole lot of medications...did I really need all that? I began to feel suppressed. While I didn't experience extreme lows, their was not any highs either. It was just flatlined. My sex drive was also non-existent. I am in my early 20s

After speaking with my Dr., we decided to lower some of my doses. He briefly told me what lowering the doses of each of my medications would do, and he gave me the liberty of experimenting a bit. I slowly trickled down to what I am currently on: 25mg of Pristiq / 150mg Bupropion / 200mg Lamictal. I do not feel as emotionally suppressed as I once was, nor do I feel extreme lows. Everything seems to be okay, aside from a few things. I know that life isn't perfect, and being 'happy' all the time isn't normal, but I do feel like I am missing some happiness in my life. Another major issue is my sex drive. It is still completely ruined and it is beginning to affect my life and overall well-being.

I guess my questions are: 

* Was taking all three of those medicines at high doses a bad thing? (In other words, is my doctor not giving good advice?) Should I seek out a 'second opinion'?

* Are there any ways to combat the sexual side effects that you have successfully utilized?

* Should I consider talking with a doctor (my current Dr. or a new one) about changing things up, if so, do you have any personal experience that would lead you to suggest a specific change here?

I was put on Latuda for about 3 weeks (1 at 10mg, 2 at 20mg) as my previous stabiliser wasn't doing much for me. I assumed my worsening depression/anxiety were withdrawals but by week 3 I ended with akathisia that has really fucked me up.

Pdoc took me off it immediately and prescribed me 0.25mg Xanax to take as needed (which I had been taking one or two of intermittently to cope with the transition) It's been 12 days since my last Latuda dose but I'm still having major depression/panic/crying fits and I'm concerned that the longer I take the Xanax the more reliant I'm going to become on it. I'm already taking between 1.25-2mg/day and while I'm having more frequent periods of stability, it's sometimes taking more Xanax to get there and boy do I come crashing down hard once that 5 hour mark passes.

Has anyone had similar experiences coming off Latuda? I'd think that with only 3 weeks on I'd be in the clear by now, but I've heard some horror stories and I'm also terrified of replacing one set of symptoms with another the longer I stay on Xanax.

My doctor initially put me on a regimen of Trileptal (300mg, 2x a day).  This did nothing to help my depression, but helped me avoid instances of hypomanic.

After a very failed experiment with Zoloft in late 2016, we settled on Wellbutrin SR 150mg which, while it has helped my depression, supposedly had the tendency to increase my anxiety.  I would not have initially known, however, because I was also taking 1mg of Klonopin per day.

Fast forward to October of 2017, at which time my doctor told me that he wanted to wean me off the Klonopin because extended use can cause cognitive impairment...which I was initially unaware of.

After weaning myself down over many months to a quarter pill in the morning, and a quarter pill at night, I have found this dosage to be completely ineffective as to my anxiety.  I have a very stressful job, which does not help matters at all.  To make matters worse, my psychiatrist has effectively retired, and I have to begin seeing a new but, from what I hear, very competent psychiatrist in mid-March.

It usually takes 24-48 hours for a prescription to be ready to pick up if they actually remember to do it. My bf is putting in an official complaint tomorrow but not sure if it'll do anything. Am I being unreasonable wanting to complain? My head is kind of fuzzy at the moment and I feel like hell. Probably withdrawal? I don't know.;559;25;101;15;15;187;97;135

860;bipolarreddit;LickingTheLimeLight;15/01/2018;"Just Some Thoughts I was on risperdal up until last year right before exams ended my senior year. I ended it in April due to lactating. I was on 4mg and it helped in every aspect. I did hate being tired, the constant headaches, heart flutters, high blood pressure, and gaining weight. It helped with my paranoia so much. It helped with my anxiety a lot.

I switched to Abilify but I couldn't afford it on insurance, so I switched to lithium. I haven't seen my doctor since I quit my restaurant job and have become a stripper. I'm on lithium, but my paranoia wasn't going away so I took a 2mg risperdal last night. 

I can't sleep when I miss a dose of lithium. I had missed 2 doses and I can't swallow the pills because they are too big for me. I usually break them and put them in yogurt, which makes it bearable. Has a metallic taste, but it's okay. Better than swallowing a whole pill. The scary thing is I can't tell if I'm going manic anymore because since I was in the hospital at 16, I don't get that high manic I was. I don't even talk fast like I used to. It's more of being highly emotionally unstable. It's more where my thoughts feel like dough in a mixer moving really fast and I can't control the settings. I did a mindful meditation video and that helped a lot.

 I'm fine right now, calm, but damn, I hate paranoid thoughts. I hate thinking ""He's only talking to me so he can get dirt on me. He doesn't like me as a person, he's faking it so he can make me lose my job."" 

There's so much stress I have and I don't have ativan nor do I want any because I'm trying to rely less on anxiety medications. I haven't had ativan in a few weeks, I found one and took it back then but it's been over a month since I ran out of my script. 

Money has also been tight and I haven't been able to afford food up until last weekend, I was living off of noodles, potatoes, and oatmeal, so I didn't want to take my lithium. My job is tricky because when I stay up late I HAVE HAVE to take the next day off because if I keep messing up my sleep cycle, I'm super unstable. I will get aggravated at small things. I will get emotional, and overthink. That's basically it when I'm off my meds. I don't really get all that delusional, but maybe I do? For example, when I'm smoking a cigarette I have to pick up a specific one because if I don't pick that specific one then things will be bad. Or if I don't hold something a certain way, things will go bad or so i think. I keep overthinking things. I'm paranoid that everyone around me that tries to talk to me doesn't really care for me unless I already know them. For example, at work, if someone tries to talk to me, I don't trust them, which is standard in my line of work, don't trust anyone. I don't like people talking to me and it's weird because I'll be having a bipolar episode or so it feels when I miss meds but I'm sleepy, I'm so so sleepy but if I stay up past 12, all hell breaks loose. I can't sleep, my whole schedule is messed up. I have to sleep before 12 to keep myself normal which is hard with my line of work.

I know I should find a new job but then again, paranoia and fear of rejection. More fear of rejection than anything. Living in fear from high school and the bullying. How people were mean and I just relive high school when I see them, but that's a battle of confidence i need to work on myself.";2622;84;582;31;62;872;277;709

I was having trouble; stress, depression, anxiety and terrible racing thoughts. I tried to find help but felt I wasn't being taken seriously by my psychologist and psychiatrist at the time; they diagnosed me with very mild autism, a lifelong condition you're born with; I was having trouble for 8 months. I googled my symptoms for days until I was convinced I had bipolar disorder. I told my psychiatrist I was seeing things, and that I was paranoid. I said that so they too would be convinced and help me get rid of those terrible racing thoughts. I ended up becoming more convinced that all of this was real. The depression got worse and worse, after a few more months I didn't want to live anymore. The racing thoughts stopped after a month of rest. The antipsychotics they put me on afterwards made me sleep all day, which was nice at first, but I lost all motivation a little while later. The antipsychotics also made me fat, which I didn't like. I was also put on lithium, which made me thirsty and made my hands tremble. At a certain point in time, I was no longer depressed. Shortly afterwards, I went on a long holiday to my parents in Africa, where I stopped taking my antipsychotics. I still take lithium, but I'm planning to stop taking that as well. I would just like to say that I do not recommend anyone to stop taking their meds; I took a lot of risks doing that and I just ended up lucky, because it turns out that I do not have bipolar disorder. I had a 2 year long bout of depression and (for 9 months) had terrible racing thoughts, triggered by (I think) burn-out syndrome, an existential crisis and possible anxiety.";1488;64;269;28;21;477;174;356

I must say for myself it has been helpful with the depression but its certainly not a fix all for me. So with that I wanted to share some tips of what I have encountered along the way with trying to afford and stay on this medication. There are some options or relief available. Not sure I'd call them solutions but instead kind of band-aids. Ultimately it wont get better until generics come out but from what I have read it doesn't look like the patent will run out till like 2026 or thereabouts.



1. When you get the script from the doc make sure to ask about samples if they are not provided first off. I got lucky and I have to say I was on this med for probably a good 3 months just on samples alone. Perhaps my practice is a bit more forgiving on that front.  I told them I had problems with getting the cost (which I did) so they gave me more samples to hold me over till payday.  There were also times I ran out before the pharmacy could get an order in, and in which case they gave me samples to hold me over till I could get filled.


2. Get the discount card!!! It says pay as little as $15 which for me brought my cost down to $150. Not great but far less than what it was. [Latuda copay Assistant](https://secure.latuda.com/secure/latuda-savings.cfm)


3.  Check if you have a preauthorization requirement for this drug. Unfortunately this might require you to call your insurance company directly. Some pharmacies might be able to tell you if its required. For me if my pdoc didnt submit a preauthorization the cost for me was near retail which is about $1300/US.


4.  Check if you have a prescription deductible. I did and at the beginning of every year it renews. So I was surprised to find that my drug I was getting for $150 was now ringing up at $400. Sadly the only way past this is to pay it. But once paid, my cost was back down.


5. McKesson the company that provides the discount card will also provide you with two 14day supplies of latuda at no cost.  That is right, **FREE**.  Just today I got my second free 14day supply of latuda. Call them up at 1-855-5-LATUDA and you can speak to a rep to get this. They will provide you with the info that is used the same as another discount card.


6.  Lastly I was told of another option they have available where they will supposedly try to negotiate a lower cost with the insurance company. I'm not sure what kind of success rate there is with this as I have not yet attempted to go this route. This will be my last ditch effort before telling doc its too much and have to find something else. In order to do this you would call the same number above 1-855-5-LATUDA and inquire talk to someone about what options are available and perhaps inquire specifically about negotiating how much the insurance cost/pay.  I only found out about this one as my insurance is always rejected with the card so I called the card company to sort it out and was somehow transferred to a rep that informed me this is what her department did, before transferring me to another.  


Anwyays, hope this helps some of you. The preauthorization and deductible points should apply to all medications and is something to consider. Its possible that the other solutions might work with other medications as well if they are cost prohibitive. 


Edit:  Looks like the patent does expire on July 2 2018. So perhaps there is hope for a generic sooner than later.";2809;97;533;46;58;893;291;680

I’ve dealt with it my whole life but never saw a doctor for it. 
In the beginning I was given an anti depressant and Adderall for ADD. 
The Wellbutrin (anti depressant) made me horrendously depressed and mixed with Adderall incited violent, irrational and unpredictable behavior. 
I then was prescribed Lamictal for my mood. 
All three of those sort of mellowed me out. Then I decided to stop Wellbutrin because it made me incredibly forgetful, even to the point f frequent black outs and loss of time/days. 

So now, I am currently on Lamictal and a very low dose of Concerta. The concerta is doing nothing. 
I have horrendous ADD and my memory is pretty much wiped clean every week. 
I am also extremely EXTREMELY tired mentally and physically every day which is not ok because I am a runner and an avid biker but I haven’t been able to work out in weeks because of this exhaustion.

871;bipolarreddit;LilyChickadee;20/04/2019;"A mother’s letter about forgiveness and psychsosis I just wanted to share a letter my mother (schizoaffective/BP I) wrote to me (bp II).

I have been here under many different usernames but the gist of it is that my mother, who I love with all of my heart, has been psychotic many times while I have grown up and the rest of my family has frequently abandoned her. She seems sometimes evil and terrifying and I can’t blame those who are less educated for being fearful.

But I feel that this letter she wrote me encompasses how human we still are in psychosis. Just because our reality is different doesn’t mean we are any less human or have any less capacity for love or caring. You are never less than simply because the reality around you changes. 

I will say I am immensely traumatized by my mothers psychosis and wouldn’t wish it on anyone or anyone’s loved ones, but I would give up anything to be there for my mother and to have lived this life being able to love and care for her.

Her letter:

I've wanted to write about this for a long time, but the memory is so special to me, I wanted the writing to do it justice.  But it just hit me that it is a good birthday sending.

Do you remember those flesh colored-flats you had?  They triggered my (manic) thought, ""walk a mile in Lilychickadees shoes.""  I bought some just like them at Walmart and would wear them when I wanted to keep you with me in spirit.  Because every time I go manic, 'They' always say, ""Lilychickadee is the strong one.""

Last spring, I had maybe three months when I was manic, but not in the hospital.  You dad wouldn't let me drive (smart man), so I took the bus everywhere.  One day I had a caseworker appointment in Edinburg.  I took the bus to the depot in downtown M, and from there another bus to E.  I told the driver to tell me when we got to FG.  He did, and I got off.  I didn't realize I got off on J.  Do you know how far J is from the Expressway where My hospital is located on FG?  Miles.  hahahaha.

So I started walking down FG.  In my mania it seemed as though the expressway moved further away from me as I walked!  I'm very serious about that.  Suddenly that purple purse I was carrying like a baby transformed into you (I used to carry you everywhere when you were a baby and the way that feels apparently doesn't leave a mother's memory.)  I was carrying you, keeping in mind how I need to walk in your shoes.  I was so so so distraught by the thought of you traumatized when taking care of me in my mania/psychosis.  I walked and walked and walked and walked.  And walked while Expressway moved further away.  You never left my mind as I carried you and walked. It turned into a way for me to prove my love for you after all you've suffered for me.  I thought I would walk and carry you like this forever if it meant you could experience some ease after struggling so hard.  

I barely made it before TT closed, and my caseworker (who I had never seen before) took so long it was the night before we left for her to drive me home.  She took Expressway and do you know, every single light:  car lights, traffic lights, expressway signs and billboards, businesses--everything that had a light, that light looked incandescent like you see psychedelic colors portrayed.  I rode with my mouth open!  All I could think is that heaven had come to earth--as in the Lord's Prayer:  ""Thy Kingdom come.""

I felt &lt;God&gt; giving his approval for how unquestionably and unfalteringly I proved my love for you.  Which made me think He set the ordeal up in the first place!

Lights--I emphasize that it was Light--have never shone like that for me again.

You are so special.
My love for you is unparalleled.

872;bipolarreddit;Limestone87;25/03/2019;"Mixed episode, first episode of any kind in years Hi all,

I just went through a mixed episode (or at least what I think was a mixed episode, never had one before) after being consistently healthy for 4+ years.  

In reflection, I’ve realized how much I’ve taken my good health for granted. I’d forgotten what it was like to feel completely out of control. I think I’ve also been in denial in the past that I ever did anything outside of my control during an episode and downplayed it, but this was the kick in the pants that reminded me what it’s really like. 

Anyway, in the aftermath there are some things that are still really getting me down (pretty sure I’m still depressed). This is the first episode I’ve had since my son was born. Before he was born I expressed to my wife that I was worried about passing bipolar on to him, and I was even more worried about having an episode while I was home alone with him. 

Well, I did end up having to be home alone with him a couple of times and it really terrifies me. At one point I was trying trying to get him into his car seat and he was giving me a really hard time. He wasn’t being intentionally difficult, really he was just playing, trying to turn off the dome light. I ended up screaming at him in my driveway while I tried to get him into the seat so I could buckle him in. He started bawling. That was early on in the episode and at that point I hadn’t realized yet that I was off in any way, but a couple minutes later I realized I had just done something that I would never, ever, ever normally do. The other times I was with him, I just felt so down that I could barely respond to his needs for food or a diaper change or whatever and definitely couldn’t play with him. It was really hard to look at him in the face. He had no idea what was going on and couldn’t understand why I couldn’t read to him or play with cars when that’s what we normally do every day. The one time I tried to read to him I started weeping before I got past the first page. 

Like I said, I was worried that something like this would happen, but I was not at all prepared to handle it,  nor was I at all prepared for how it would make me feel. After screaming at him I’m worried I’m going to become violent. And when I have trouble feeding him, it’s just an overwhelming feeling that I can’t take care of the kid that depends on me just to survive. I feel completely unable to parent properly and like I am a complete failure as a dad. It has me wondering if my family would be better off without me (not necessarily in a suicidal kind of way, more like should I just leave?). In my mind I keep telling myself I’m being irrational, but it’s pretty hard to believe right now. My wife knows I’m feeling down still and last night she asked me if I was going to be ok with him in the morning (I get him ready for the day and take him to childcare for the day because she leaves early). I know it’s a necessary question, but the fact that it even needs to be asked really cuts deep. 

Anyway, idk what I’m really looking for with this post. Just needed to get it out.

I hadn’t had any issues until this year. I’ve always been moody and could change at the drop of a hat. But I never considered that abnormal for me.
I had one experience a few weeks ago where I felt I could have been manic. I was at work and just in a great mood, nothing could shake me, overly peppy and talkative. I couldn’t focus very well, my mind was just jumping from thing to thing. My boyfriend who works with me pointed out that I wasn’t acting normal after I had already kind of noticed the elevated mood myself. I was trying not to fixate on it but once he pointed it out it started making me very anxious. 
Since then I’ve been keeping track of my moods with an app because my boyfriend also pointed out that it’s not the only time I’ve acted odd and I sometimes don’t notice it at all. 
I just started seeing a therapist and when I brought this up to her she told me the feeling has to last days to be mania. From what I’ve read hypomania doesn’t have to be long lasting.

I've been seeing my pdoc for years and she's great and I trust her, and we spent two years figuring out the formula for my comorbid cocktail. Before I was diagnosed bipolar obvs life was miserable, but I was able to take a higher dosage of the SSRI I still take (Lexapro) and maybe I'm remembering with rose colored shades, but I feel like back then, while my life may have been spiraling out of control, the anxiety wasn't quite so paralyzing. We've tried multiple times to increase the Lexapro, but every time I become catatonically emotionless within the week, so I know at least for Lexapro that's not a viable option.
My pdoc seems to think that the anxiety is more situational than chemical, but I can't help but feel this isn't a normal (or completely unmedicateable) level of crippling anxiety to feel constantly. 
At the same time this isn't an ideal point in my life to go gambling with switching up my meds again. 
Is it really just impossible for some of us to find chemical relief from anxiety in a way that won't throw off the balance of the mood stabilizers? I know I should pursue DBT or CBT but $ makes that really difficult right now when I already pay my pdoc out of pocket and am broke as a joke. Is it pessimistic or deluded to think there's no way something other than medication could treat my anxiety the way meds did in the past? I know therapy could help with depression and such, but what of the every-second-of-everyday anxiety that is definitely not entirely situational and has not improved with changing situational circumstances? If the anxiety was caused by something specific I might be more optimistic about CBT/DBT, but it's just... generalized. It doesn't go away.

I love the seaside, it is where I go when I need to calm my mind. I texted work letting them know I wouldn’t be in work today then went and found a place to sit! Today was different though, instead of calming thoughts and feeling refreshed, my head was spinning with thoughts like walking into the sea or stepping in front of a train anything to just end it all.

In a panic I ran back to the train station, getting on the first train home. 35 minuets into the journey the train stopped. A person had stepped out in front of the train I was on. My mind was all over, at the time I was thinking it was a sign. I thought about it for the next 3 hours and had basically talked myself into doing it. By time I had reached my car I had managed to buy enough packets of pills to take my own life. 

I started to take them, I had taken about 100/150 pills and then in a split second I changed my mind. I ran back to the train station looking for help. I was crying so much I couldn’t even get my words out I kind of just threw my empty packets at the feet of the first ‘official’ person I found. 

Within a few hours I was in hospital and my mum was there. The next few days I had explained what had happened. My mum didn’t believe me, she refused to believe it. She would say things like ‘but you’re always so happy’, ‘you have no reason to do something like that’ or ‘it just doesn’t make sense’. 

So that was the first time I really knew I had a problem, work organised for me to see a councilor. I had 6 sessions, but I felt like I was getting nowhere. So, I stopped going.

I went to my local doctor’s office, and they gave me some pills. Then some more pills and again some more. Most of the time I would just stopped taking my pills as they started causing me problems with my job.  A few years later I felt like I was no better, so I decided to start therapy again, and once again I got nowhere, the therapist would call me by the wrong name or show up late. So, I stopped going. After a few months my doctor sent me to a new therapist it was here that my therapist told me she believed I was Bipolar. I felt like I had answers and I could fix it on my own. So, I stopped going.

A few weeks later I relocated to be with my boyfriend over 100 miles from ‘home’ and from my Doctors. But I felt great, my mind was distracted by all the new things going on I felt happy and normal for once. Boy was I wrong!! Once everything had settled down it hit me and hard! Self-harm was on my mind ALL the time! It still is but since moving to a new house I feel like the change is distracting me right now and everything will come back once I am not so busy. I also feel like I am not good enough and that I am alone despite having an amazing boyfriend and a great job.

I know that I need to go to my new doctors and get some help but at the same time I don’t want to because I am scared! I don’t know much or anything about the treatment for being Bipolar but if the road is as rocky as it was when I was being treated just for depression I am not sure I could cope.

I promised my boyfriend I would try and get help, and in my mind, I want to but only when I physically can’t. Like the middle of the night or on a weekend. 

I need help to overcome this by someone who understands how I am feeling but no one does ? 

TL:DR After an attempted suicide I tried to get help and for years nothing worked, I tired therapy and medication. I finally found out I am bipolar, but I relocated before I started treatment and can’t bring myself to go to my new doctor to get treatment. Need advice from someone who understands.";3147;109;688;27;57;1018;304;837

He is currently out of work (for going on 8mos) and obviously also uninsured. He went to a psych on his sister's bill about 5mos ago, was prescribed Abilify, did not like the initial side effects so refuses to take it. I can't afford to send him to a new pdoc and a lot of his family is not speaking to him rn because along with losing his job her burned most of his bridges.

How realistic is it that we could get him committed and maybe get a new prescription that way? Is this a horrible idea? Will it make him worse? I have not proposed it yet but his counselor did about a month ago. Please help wonderful people of this amazing community.

I have been working my way out of a depressive episode that started in November but the stress of this job is a major contributing factor to keeping me down.  The job pays poorly but is part time and offers health insurance, allows me to work alone for the most part, and I start work at 10.  Honestly have no idea how I will get better if I stay at this job because I cannot emphasize enough how much it is affecting me.  There is no point in trying to change anything about the job because oh my GOD I have tried.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an interview for a temp job that would have me working 8:30-5:30.  I am getting desperate to start a new job and earn more money.  However, I am really bad with sleep disruption- just a time change can be a trigger for me- and I would need to get up two hours earlier.  I have non-manic related insomnia that keeps me up at times, but I have depended on the ability to sleep in to make sure I don't become sleep deprived.  Being at work so early feels risky since I can't seem to fall asleep before midnight on somewhat regular basis and it leaves no room for flexibility.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been searching for a job that can accommodate my needs for MONTHS with no luck.  I'm a little concerned that I may be flipping up since I am having a sudden lack of sleep and am afraid a big change will trigger a hypomanic episode or exacerbate the depression.  I have no idea what my options are since all jobs seem to start at the crack of dawn and leave very little flexibility for sleep.  But I need money.

I don't know what to do.  Advice or support would help.  I feel so lost and I don't know what I need.

890;bipolarreddit;lordhooters;17/02/2019;nightmare related to my bipolar disorder I have been extremely manic the past week or so and a few nights ago I experienced a nightmare that really irked me. I get weird dreams and nightmares quite a lot but this one was extremely unsettling. It started off with me walking down a street in the city I live in and I could see something up ahead so I started walking towards it. When I got close enough I saw a person with a bag over their head being held in handcuffs by two men and was wearing a nightgown of some sort with “BIPOLAR” written across it. They were knocking door to door telling people to stay away from people with bipolar disorder and that they’re freaks. I started running down the street and I passed two children in a window sewing dolls (not sure what that was about but pretty creepy) and after that I woke up. Overall it was a horrifying dream and I would like to know if anyone else with bipolar disorder has had a nightmare similar to that. ;772;34;141;11;13;240;113;184

I'm only 3 hours away now (I would be closer but my company doesn't have operations any closer than where I'm at...  Changing jobs is not an option for me at the moment).

So I cook for them,  make sure to buy my own groceries, buy some for them, help out around the house, etc.  So, all in all, I'm in about as comfortable a spot that I could ask for under the otherwise shitty circumstances.  Sorry about the long windedness...  But I guess I'm stuck in a bit of an ""episode."" It's understandable under these circumstances, but I don't think I've behaved like this before.

896;bipolarreddit;lost-in-limbo1990;02/04/2018;"Here we go again: EMDR Take 2 I have PTSD as the result of an extensive history of sexual abuse. My therapist guided me through 9 months of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) in 2016. It was BRUTAL, but my symptoms were nearly nonexistent after we finished it up. I recently have had some symptoms pop back up, and after an assessment it appears that I’m in need of a “tune up” as my therapist calls it. So here we go again... I’m starting it again today. I hope that it’ll be a little less sucky since I’ve put some hard work into it previously and that it’ll be short-lived compared to 9 months of nonstop weekly EMDR sessions. I’m still EXTREMELY anxious as I get closer and closer to my appointment today because I know that things will get worse before they get better.

Has anyone been through EMDR before? Do you have any coping skills that help you, especially in between sessions when your brain is processing everything? 

PS: For the record, I’m not trying to scare anyone who is facing the possibility of going through this process. Doing EMDR has changed my life for the better. I’ve had PTSD as long as I can remember, and the relief that it’s brought me has been amazing. Just stick it out until it gets better. ";987;37;173;18;18;327;138;237

I've never felt quiet right, but I tried to accept it as I never wanted to be categorized as someone who's mentally ill. But lately I notice I'm getting worse and the only way to describe it for me when I found the word 'Manic depression'/'Bipolar'. It's as if I felt understood for the first time. A lot of my time I spend alone on my room, except when I go out to meet friends. So my family doesn't know much of my personality. Last summer I had a job at the same restaurant my sister works and she/coworkers noticed how  I'm often staring into space while smiling, and this is a big part of me. Whenever I experience this full on power high feeling, as described by people during manic depression, I get lost in my fantasies and I feel as if the world surrounding me no longer exist and build up whole scenario's and imagine people to be near me. For example I would imagine to be in a big house, while holding a conversation with a person I want to speak with and I would laugh at their jokes as if it were their jokes. most of the time my life is amazing in these deep daydreams, sometimes they could be described as another persons nightmare. I'm not even hating this. I feel a part of it is a coping mechanism which goes hand in hand with my natural creativity. And I love the force of energy I have during these moments. How I can smile as if I'm drunk just by staring and thinking about all the amazing things i can accomplish. by thinking how charming I am. And then the next second I could cry. I'm not sure if it's how I really feel, sad. Or if it's an overload of happiness that makes me sad in the moment. ButI really burst of energy in which I actually do accomplish a lot. I know it's not a healthy me, but it's the best version of myself if I want to get things done. I feel as if it isn't totally me, but more a phase. But I love who I am during this phase. Because the other part of me is depressed and has no energy. I hate admitting to this part, because while I know my life situation sucks and would had likely made anyone insane, and as I have experienced horrible things and have anxiety, I hate accepting that a big other side of me is useless by depression. As I feel like I'm constantly trying to fight it and these moments of feeling high/happy actually make me feel at times as if I'm on the right track. But now I read more about this subject, I feel I'm not winning any battle at all when feeling high on energy, is just another extreme on the spectrum. The weirdest thing I have done in these daydreams is travel to another country because I felt like i could(financielle it wasnt the greatest choice), like it could be amazing. I fell asleep in the airplane and once I woke up i was wondering what I was doing. I don't regret it and still had an okay time for a couple of days, but i do notice it isn't normal behaviour and cried one night wishing to be home again.   


I'm planning to upload soon a cover of me singing on the internet, but i'm slightly afraid of the attention among friends I will get, as it will likely impact my emotions.

I've been spending a lot of time in bed and not leaving the house, sleeping a lot, suicidal (but not acting on it) basically depressed AF. 

Anyway, my mind recently started having flash backs to stupid decisions and things I've don't while I've been manic. This isn't just the most recent manic episode - it's flashbacks from my entire life. I did some not so great things, made some not so great choices and went through some traumatic shit. I keep trying to meditate or do breathing exercises to let the thoughts pass. Anyway it's not going well- it's pretty much been mental torture. Physically, it makes me cry out of nowhere, have panic attacks, crazy sleep patterns, throw up and some other fun stuff.

920;bipolarreddit;macnsleaze;27/02/2018;"The Lithium struggle bus I have fluctu-weighted many times in my life, but I was by far the fattest towards the end of 2017. I've been steadily shedding pounds but a couple of weeks ago I started taking Lithium again. And while it's helped the mania, as of yesterday I've entered a new world of despair about my body:
So this past weekend I suddenly put on (at least) 10 pounds of water weight after binge eating socially and consuming hella sodium (I wish I could sue myself). I was also dehydrated because I'd been vomiting from the startup. My body quickly blew up like a balloon, my favorite sweatpants even became tight. I was uncomfortably bloated all over (I think the more fat you have, the more water you retain). Including my face-- which felt heavy &amp; the bags under my eyes were dark as hell.
So last night I drank a LOT of water, thinking that would fix it. But it only made everything worse. I peed ~10,000 times then went to bed. This morning I woke up and was pleasantly surprised with how tiny I looked. However, then I realized that my boobs looked different. They're still heavy, but squishier and hang a little lower. And my stomach is squishier. I can barely feel fingers against my skin now. My face has more wrinkles, my neck/chin curve feels loose. I feel like I've aged years overnight.
I fluctuated a net amount of at least 20 pounds in 2 short days, quickly up then back down. And now my skin is stretched too big for my body!?? If it is this loose already, I'm terrified to keep losing weight. I know it happened so fast. Freshman + sophomore year I was so thin and beautiful and taut. :( Im a senior now, so I was already feeling shitty before this happened. Feels like I've lost myself. Who is this bitch in the mirror with the body of a postpartum mother of quintuplets....???? I've never come close to having a kid, let alone 5. Yet here I am. And I don't know if I should try to fill back out a lil or what?

Then someone brought me a treat, these gluten free cookies and chocolate soy milk.  I ate the cookies, and as time progressed, started to feel more unstable.  Like unpleasantly stimulated, unfocused, bloated, and I was up all night with insomnia and strange sensations going on in my body.  I then read the ingredients on the cookies, and it contained xanthan gum, and tapioca starch, and I decided to be cautious about those ingredients, and didn't have any more cookies. 

I didn't however read the ingredients on the chocolate soy milk, which turned out to also have xanthan gum.  I kept drinking this for three days, and my insomnia became steadily more severe, and I started having to rely on sedatives again to sleep.  My mood was also elevating, and it became harder to focus on anything.  I was feeling insanely promiscuous :S Then by day four, my anxiety and panic skyrocketed.  I ended up getting SO desperate, feeling hyper social and feeling so needy and vulnerable and afraid that it made me reckless, making dangerous plans, needing to meet up with any man or else I was convinced I'd die.  I NEEDED someone to hold me OR ELSE.... Almost got myself in some trouble, and was NOT thinking at all.  Thankfully I managed to stay in the house, and not act, mostly because my family came back early and I could no longer have any strange men from the internet over........

Anyway, since I stopped drinking that chocolate milk, I still have anxiety but am finally feeling a bit... more settled...... I'm back to being my introverted self again, and not wanting to socialize at all, and am just thankful that nothing really bad happened.  

I'm just confused about WHY that happened to me.  Also, during that whole time, I was horribly bloated.

Can anyone relate to anything like this?

I'm confused and feel alone in this.  And this isn't something anyone else really understands.

931;bipolarreddit;Maniackolapse;16/04/2019;"Bipolar w/ ASMR (sidenote on New Age culture &amp; spirituality) Anyone else experiences ASMR on top of your manic episodes? I have type 1 ASMR and Bipolar 1 and I've found it to be a deadly combination. When manic, I'll come up with these metaphysical laws and--despite how compulsive and irrational as fuck they are--  get this huge flood of stimulation from the back of my head all the way to my feet that makes it seem like the universe is confirming my understanding. It got to a point in my development where I believed I was given the date of the end of the world and that the afterlife was split 80% enslaved and 20% saved. 

Months later, my life has blown into ruins and what was once seeming so inexplicably clear now seems psychotic. Is there a lesson to be had from all of this or can it all be written off as manic thinking? 

Sidenote: what's extra complicating on top of all of this is the thirst that new age culture seems to have on pondering spirituality and metaphysics. On the one hand, it's nice that there is a community (albeit niche) that embraces neurodivergence and ""out of the box"" thinking. On the other, I'm finding it dangerous because of the community's willingness to affirm these manic thoughts that Im having as reality. The twofold affirmation had me push towards accepting all these thoughts as absolute truths and burning bridges with people that wouldn't accept what I was experiencing. This ended up being a lot of fucking people and I ended up homeless.

Reality has it's own plans, to which remaining blissfully unaware can provide a temporary sense of comfort when staring into the face of eternity. Depending on others for happiness is a reliable way to perpetually avoid adressing the root causes that prevent you from finding it within yourself.

Even an otherwise functional and healthy relationship will crumble under the weight of one sides inability to truly form a connection, given they lack the emotional stability needed to build a solid foundation.

Bipolar patients need mood stabilizers. Lithium or lamictal. That is what treats your mood disorder and for the most part what you will always need. Other symptoms, either bipolar in nature or created by the mood stabilizer, get treated by other secondary meds. Insomnia? Probably seroquel. Psychotic features? Probably abilify. Tremors? Gabapentin. Anxiety? Stay the fuck away from benzos even if they try to give them to you. 

Is this generally the consensus? I feel like in the mental health community people just think drugs are drugs and maybe something will work eventually. That feels sad from my perspective. I do 1800mg Li along with 10g seroquel to sleep as needed, 25mg bupropion as needed during seasonal depression, and 40mg propranolol for performance anxiety when I need to perform. It’s a lot of drugs, but it’s really just the lithium at the core of it.

Over the years, I've constantly inquired about what sort of side effects I would experience on this drug and every single time, my doctors have been frustratingly vague and flippant, never sitting down and going through the effects in a thorough and detailed manner.
 
&gt;As a result, I've had to do my own research and recently, I uncovered several side effects that NO ONE told me about:

&gt;According to what I've read in numerous articles and medical journals, prolonged/long term usage of sodium valporate can apparently CAUSE depressive episodes and according to the many medical journals I've perused, it is not as effective against treating depressive bipolar episodes in the long run. Considering that I've been dealing with crippling bouts of depression over the last 7 years, this makes sense but no-one told me. NO ONE TOLD ME.

&gt;It can cause pancreatic damage and liver problems on it's own. My pyschiatric doctor (the one who typically prescribes me this shit on a 3 monthly basis) has been constantly drilling it into me that all the times I've gotten elevated liver enzyme readings from my 6-8 weekly blood tests has been because I drank alcohol whilst taking this fucking medication. Not once has she ever stopped to inform me that this stuff causes liver problems all by itself regardless of whether you drink or not, let alone any mention of trouble involving the pancreas, which is typically characterized by intense cramping/pain in the abdomen due to organ damage and inflammation of the pancreas. This makes SO MUCH SENSE considering that all these years I've had near-daily cramping and aches in my abdomen that I always previously thought was due to IBS or my IUD being a dick.

&gt;Apparently, it can increase the likelihood of polycystic ovary syndrome and something called hyperandrogenism which I have never heard of before now but is a condition to do with having too many androgens or male hormones/testosterone in the body along with uterine fibroids which also explains the agonizing cramps I often get regardless of what time of the month it is. Also, I was at child-bearing age (22) when they first started me on sodium valporate and whilst I have no desire to ever procreate, the fact of the matter is that all these conditions lead to infertility so I feel incredibly deceived by the doctors who put me on this shit because again, NO-ONE TOLD ME ANY OF THIS.

&gt;I am absolutely steaming and yet I just know that if/when I raise these issues with my current psych doctor, she will no doubt laugh off my concerns like she always fucking does and dismiss my worries as trivial.

&gt;I know it's dangerous to quit cold turkey but I honestly feel so betrayed right now considering all that I've learned. I ended up writing a strongly worded but teeth-grittingly ""polite"" letter outlining all these concerns so I can slap her in the face with it- not literally but y'know- and get my voice heard.

&gt;I want to change my doctor and try to get one who will help me find an alternative course of treatment but giving that all this happened on public healthcare (which is often laughably crap at times here), it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being a long drawn out process.

&gt;Urgh. I'm so angry I could spit fire!";3082;150;478;66;32;978;341;680

I'm transitioning from lithium+wellbutrin therapy to hopefully just standalone lamotrigine.

I'm starting to feel better regardless of medications, and have been taking 25mg lamotrigine for a week now. It's unfortunate it takes so long to get up to a therapeutic dose on this medication, but I know it's worth it to be patient.

My pdoc prescribed adderall about a year and a half ago to counteract the sedation I feel even after taking my meds at night. Lately my muscles are so stiff and sore I can hardly move and sometimes it hurts so much I can't do anything but just cry. After taking my meds and laying down in bed, my nose stuffs up out of nowhere and I can't breathe at all and my heart starts pounding and when I try to breathe out of my mouth and finally start falling asleep I can feel my breath slowing down and I panic that I'm going to stop breathing and I jerk awake. My legs are so restless and twitchy and I get so frustrated and I can't breathe and I don't know what to do other than just sob and wait it out until the seroquel knocks me out. This lasts for an hour or two every night. I don't even want to take the meds anymore because I know how shitty I'm going to feel. I don't even want to go to sleep anymore. I know when I tell my pdoc she's just going to try to convince me to switch back to lithium which I will never do. I had horrible painful acne so bad I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror without sobbing and wanting to die (her response was ""wear makeup"").

961;bipolarreddit;mental_chillness_;12/02/2019;"How I stopped letting anxiety spirals control my life (xpost r/mentallyhealthier) I used to spend most of the day caught up in anxiety spirals. I used to fall into the trap of getting stuck in the past and beating myself up about mistakes, or fretting about the way things could go wrong in the future. (There's a term for this- rumination.) The only way I've found out of this terrible habit is through mindfulness meditation.

Mindfulness is paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment.

Figuring this out, the idea that you can live your life without reliving your life story, has significantly improved my quality of life.

I recently read this study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19733812](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19733812)

The participants engaged in Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction therapy, and the conclusion was ""the more mindfulness meditation had been practiced, the less rumination was reported at follow-up assessment."" Though the participants were in a full on 8 week course of therapy, you can easily do this yourself with some effort.

Basically, the goal is to “decenter” from thoughts and emotions, to see thoughts come and go without attaching any important truth or meaning to them.

I’ve had a friend (M) for quite a few years that suffers from bipolar disorder. M didn’t tell me about it until a good couple years into the friendship; they were in the midst of an episode, and I (not knowing what was really going on) regrettably lashed out because I didn’t understand why they had been constantly upset and irritable with me.  After that, we had a much better understanding and M did a great job of redirecting their anger so I wasn’t getting the brunt of it. However, they’ve been under quite a bit of stress lately, and although they are not usually directly lashing out at me, they’ve taken an emotional turn for the worse. M seems to be in a constant state of negativity, always turning every small difference of opinion into an argument, and going on angry rants about it. It feels like every time I talk about anything, they always have a negative rebuttal. They’ve become very reclusive, so we hardly ever go out anymore, if I suggest events or concerts or outings, they don’t want to go, and can only think about why it’d be a bad time. If something goes wrong, their night/mood is ruined (for example, if they didn’t want pickles on their sandwich and got pickles, rather than take them off, M just throws it away, doesn’t eat, and remains livid about the fact they didn’t get to eat, and eventually leaves for home early because they’re so upset). Our friend group usually gathers at my place, so at this point it’s like I’m trying to tip toe around broken glass in my own home, lest I say something to upset them.  Lastly, the most worrisome thing to me is that they will sometimes joke about how they got so angry they punched their arm/leg/bedroom wall/etc., and the damage is visible. 

They are currently on medication (from what I’ve witnessed mostly just helps more with the mania) and see a psychiatrist pretty regularly, but they don’t see a therapist (though they’ve admitted they could probably benefit from one).  I want to be a better friend to them, but I myself struggle with depression and it makes that difficult at times. 

I guess I’m asking for advice because I don’t know how to approach a conversation about this behavior. My worst fear is that M will misunderstand my intentions. They are my best friend, and I’d do anything for them, but the friendship is starting to take a mental toll on me as well. ";1977;74;368;37;21;637;242;479

I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 &amp; C-PTSD (repetitive childhood trauma and abuse) , 4 years ago. Mainly after a severe 6mo. Long manic episode in which I was convinced I was indestructible and a direct channel of god, resulting in multiple unintended near death experiences related to drugs, alcohol and physical safety. 

Long story short, “bipolar” in itself has been one hell of a show. Since my first severe episode I have experienced a multitude of smaller shorter lived episodes 2 out of 4 which would probably even fall in the hypomanic category. The depression always lasts much longer (usually 2/3X times longer than the initial mania) but it never comes with out visual &amp; auditory hallucinations, explosive anger, psychosis and catatonic moments lasting no less than 3 hours at a time. I’m 21 years old. The lines are starting to get blurry. I don’t know where the episodes end and begin. I am scared as fuck and have had a handful of clarity moments that reveal the way my brain seems to be slipping through my fingers. I tried to tapper off my lithium (my doc is on board) thinking that much of this time spent somewhere else / staring at a wall only to snap back a few hours later confused as to where the time went - was just because of my high dose of 1250mg lithium carbonate. I’ve tapered down to 300mg at night and 300mg in the morning and my partner has started to point out that I seem to exhibit ALL symptoms of bipolar each day, simultaneously and more consistently. 

Redditors, I’m usually better spoken but my brains in shambles and I’m eager for you to make me think deeper on this and reflect before I word barf it to my psych.

978;bipolarreddit;miepert;24/01/2019;"Hello, concerned daughter here Hello,

I hope this isn't against the rules but I'm posting here hoping to find some advice and a little support. I'm (f26) from Holland and my mom (55) has been in the psychiatric hospital for about 3 months now. 
Looking back, I guess she already hit a manic state about 7 months back. The trigger seemed to be a renovation (of the whole area) that started in September 2018. She was constantly worried that I was going to be raped by the construction crew. At a certain I wasn't allowed to do any chores at home and she started treating me like I was 9 or something.

Then she stopped taking her meds, she offered her body to a friend (even though she is disgusted by sex) and started going on shopping sprees. 

She only got commited cuz she kept me up at night for a week straight, which sorta forced her to seek help. Now she blames me for getting her commited. She also told me my stepdad doesn't want to have sex with me because I'm fat (I have been diagnosed with  c-ptsd because of past abuse of a familymember so this was extremely hurtful on multiple levels). She accused me trying to control her when I asked her why she didn't pay rent, and suddenly my boyfriend is too dumb and autistic to function and she hates his guts.

This isn't even half of the things she has done or said. I'm am tired and exhausted. She suddenly came home today, late at night, because she claims she is getting abused by the everyone and she left. I quickly packed a bag and left to go to my stepdads house, she freaked out, started yelling then asked her if I could forgive her.

Here's the thinge, I don't doubt it that she will get better. But I am constantly incredible angry and upset, I have no patience anymore. I am constantly swinging between being scared she is going to hurt herself and just hoping that she does, just so I can be done with all of this. 
I feel guilty and I am just drained of all my energy  all the damn time.

Is there anything I can do? Is there any advice you guys have for me when dealing with my mother? I don't want to hate her after all of this is done.

P.s. I am already looking at other housing options and an in-house therapist of my doctors clinic is helping me trying to get urgency to move. I am also in a lot of contact with the people from the mental facility my mom is commited in. School is also quite aware of what is going on, I can always stay at my stepdads house (who has never done anything weird to me, ever) and my boyfriend is an angel who is always ready to help me. I am exercising, eating right and always try to get 8 hours of sleep.

I had high anxiety during pregnancy, and the anxiety has lingered, along with deepening depressive episodes partially due to loneliness and postpartum. I’m in school (online) for digital media design, and I’m trying to get a job working at home. My husband works as a teacher at a school 35 minutes away, so we don’t see him until later in the evenings.

Anybody have any ideas for how to manage the depression and cycling until April? I have self-destructive tendencies (self-harm, food issues, etc), and am trying to avoid falling back into those habits. I’m open to nearly anything - I’m a Christian, but I’m open to almost anything. Links appreciated too. Thanks!";1198;50;204;27;22;390;169;280

982;bipolarreddit;MinuteDesk;17/02/2018;"Someone in my life's illness has got much worse. I'd like to know what to expect Hi

I was involved with someone's life for a long time. This person was diagnosed with Bipolar with serious manic episodes, and treated for about 13 years. The meds were hard to take and she was a bit up and down with them. There were some serious manic episodes that led to dangerous situations. There was little I could do, but I did help keep her on track and try to keep her honest with the meds.

I realise that it must be so awful to have to take dulling medication, and I'm really sympathetic to how these manic events and dropping off Lithium built up. I don't want to sound judgemental.

Fast forward to now. As of three years ago I no longer have any influence or connection, but have stepped in to help in a really bad episode. It's become clear that she has not really taken her medication seriously for three years. She's been totally freewheeling. The illness I saw in her recently was very different to what I knew from before. I had seen her as driven and worked up, but her moods were cycling from extremes within minutes. It was frightening.

I have read up as much as I can on bipolar and rapid cycling. I get the picture that some people advance towards this after every major episode, and that it tends to be progressive, and not go back to being a single flavour at a time so to speak.

Can anyone who has experienced bipolar progressing like this (in yourself or in a loved one) give me a perspective? I'm concerned that she's progressed past some kind of horizon and things are going to be harder for her even on Lithium now. Just a gut feeling.

I would appreciate hearing relevant experiences. Thank you. Keep up the fight guys, you're all doing great in this forum.";1406;58;261;27;24;452;186;339

Today is Saturday and thankfully his practice is open on weekends. I haven’t called yet, but I will when they open. The pain is worse this morning.

And then I realized that every time I get a cold, I recheck the symptoms of the flu, pneumonia, etc. in order to rule those things out.

If I get a rash, I will look up different rashes to make sure it’s not some flesh eating bacteria. I had shingles behind my knees last year and wrote it off as dermatitis and didn’t go to see my doctor until it hurt too much to walk.

I guess I’m sort of the opposite. I try to rule out worse illnesses? But then I thought - hey, maybe that’s how you justify it, but you’re a hypochondriac silly.

1000;bipolarreddit;MollySPrentiss;04/04/2018;My therapist thinks I may be bipolar. So, I just saw a new therapist and I was describing the symptoms I experience. Back when I wasn't on medications, I used to have huge highs and devastating lows. During my highs, I was more confident than usual, my mood was highly elevated, I was more energetic and I would be excessively talkative. Every time that happened, though, I would experience a crash. I would become desperately depressed, with suicidal ideation, worthlessness, etc. With each crash worse than the last. This cycle probably occurred 20 times in a span of about a year. After telling him this, he said that it sounds a lot like bipolar. He's a therapist, not a doctor, so obviously, no diagnosis. My doctor put me on Latuda along with my Zoloft and Wellbutrin. One thing I noticed about my high periods, is that sometimes, I would get a little giddy in the day prior to the high. I also noticed that I still needed a full night's sleep. I just sleep more when in a depression. I've wanted to stop my Zoloft, because my depression persists when I'm on it and I really miss the highs I used to have.  ;877;36;157;23;17;292;118;208

1002;bipolarreddit;MonksMoodStabilizer;15/01/2018;"Do you have phases? I do. I've noticed a structure and pattern of my phases as it relates to my level of brain activity from depression to hypomania. I hope sharing this will clarify these cycles for others. I have a lot of phases of interest. Sometimes they reoccur, sometimes they're one-offs. It's frustrating to be passionate about something, and then stop. But I know it's because my moods change.

I've come to some observations about my phases and even have a little theory about them, although it may just be limited to my case. Here's the theory:

My phases fall into four categories. At the lowest level, there is basic pleasures. Some basic pleasures I've had are baseball, harry potter, and Disney movies. Next there is high pleasure: e.g., classical music, jazz music, and Shakespeare. Then I have phases of personal development: losing weight, learning musical skills, learning Spanish. Finally I have the highest order of phases where I have a sense of duty: I've become vegan and buddhist out of this level.

I feel like these phases accord to a particular level of brain activity, from low to high. I think everyone falls somewhere on this dimension at a given moment. I also think healthy people have a smaller average range of categories of particular interest: some people skew basic to high, some high to personal development, some just are adept at acting on a sense of duty.

At least in my case, I run the full gamut. At a depressed level, I have basic interests (at a certain level of depression one my have NO interest, but I don't get that low). At a hypomanic level, I have a grandiose sense of duty. However, I feel like I have a natural balance. I feel like I have an ideal scope like anyone else, but I have no balance of brain activity. I feel at my ""most me"" when I am at a mix of high pleasure and personal development.

I've also noticed a pattern of logical progression from disordered to ordered interest in my life. Say I start at my healthy level: high–deveopment. When I approach a sense of runaway personal development, I become grandiose about that development. Then I may achieve a personal sense of duty to apply that development. Of course, my deveopment only goes so far, and my sense of duty goes farther, so I burn out. Then in a depressed mode, I land in basic pleasure. With higher mood after building basic pleasures, I ""grade them up"" to high pleasures, from which point I have more confidence in my ability to develop related skills. The cycle restarts.

This is very interesting to me, but all I've really done is describe a pattern of disordered mood change in terms of its effects on human interest and concern, and apply conceptions of general human interests and concern in doing so.

But I actually think I have a lifestyle tip for myself based on this theory. I'm at the high level of the personal development stage right now, and could approach an abnormal sense of duty. First of all, by recognizing this generalized progression, I can catch any slip ups early, and so can my support circle. But what really interests me is how I can adjust my personal development habits toward a more healthy progression.

Right now my personal development topic is math. Math is an extremely broad topic in terms of range of difficulty and scope. I could get frustrated with basic algebra, or I could obsess over an unsolved problem way out of my league. But I think about another personal development habit I had: weight loss.

When I lost weight, it was a development of daily regiment, one where I ate a little less every day and gradually lost weight. Normally, I have a seasonal peak of hypomania where I have that grandiose duty. After the regimented challenge of losing weight became difficult, I went to a modestly, fairly euthymic basic pleasure. The nature of the challenge didn't involve runaway progress because of how structured it was.

Applying that lesson to my math development, I could continue to over stress myself with difficult problems, or I could make it a daily grind. I could even get a tutor to make sure I stay on a good track. Perhaps I wouldn't have to go to a toxic level of stimulation and go hypomanic, and just cool off, adding a daily practice to my life.

Thinking this way has opened up some different options about how to deal with my moods, as well as who I really am. I see my doctor tomorrow, and I look forward to discussing these ideas with him.

---

Note about ""high"" and ""low"" pleasures: I didn't mean to call anyone's hobby ""high"" or ""low"". I think it's completely relative. I think something high for me could be low for someone else. I strongly believe whether a pleasure is high or low, at least in a mental health context, depends on the kind of enjoyment one gets out of it. It's something one can really know if one really asks themselves and is honest.";3848;179;613;105;58;1290;338;884

I tried taking Vyvanse again, at a lower dose than the previous dose that made me manic. And I was OK for about a week before the symptoms started showing up. Namely, lying (about anything) and some risky behaviors. Luckily, not drinking and drugs, but I did take a hit off of a vape pen, which I know is super bad for my brain (no matter how much analog weed I can smoke.) I decided on Saturday to stop taking it.

And Sunday I blew up.

We were having a disagreement about how to best spend our day on Sunday. I wanted to stay Very Busy, and he wanted to take his time. Which is no big deal at all and shouldn't have been what set me off. But it did, and I was in the History of Pain.

My History of Pain is a mindset I get into when manic brain meets remotely challenging parts of my relationship. Suddenly, I am the victim of circumstance and have been forever and will be forever: He doesn't love me, he's shown how he doesn't love me in every action, and on top of that, I don't deserve love for how terrible I am and the terrible things I've done.

And then I'm hitting myself in the head over and over and over, and bashing my skull into anything I can get my hands on.

And then it subsides, and I'm crying, and he wants to get away from me, and I don't understand.

And then it's quiet, and he's mad and I'm still crying, and it seems like I'll never stop and we'll never be happy again.

And then it's quiet, and he's quiet and I'm quiet.

And then we're in the car and talking about the news, and all I want is to be held, but that's asking too much too soon.

I should've trusted my body sooner- there were warning signs that the Vyvanse was going to push me over the edge, and I went willingly. And why? Because Vyvanse would help me achieve my goals, surely, but at the cost of myself and him.

Everything has a cost, and this cost was too high. Sure, he and I are OK now, but there's the threat of so many next times, and eventually, he'll walk.";1594;45;344;23;31;532;201;425

**Version with pertinent information:** I just started school to get my real estate license. I'm *really* proud of myself for taking it on, haha, but I have run into a problem. Like so many here I dont sleep well and pretty much never at night. I go to class in the evening, get out about 10:30, go to the gym, then come home. At this point I'd normally waste the rest of the night on the internet but now I have serious studying to do. I live with my parents so Im confined to my room at night for light and sound reasons. The thing is, I'm finding it *very difficult* to study there because it's not fun to do and I am surrounded by entertainment options! I do really well at the library but it's obviously closed in the middle of the night and I'm having a hard time getting up early enough to get there before class. (I've been sleeping from about 10am to about 3pm.)

I'm trying to be a big boy and just have some will power but I figured I'd see if you guys have any ideas of places that I could study at night? Thought there might be some other night owls here with experience in 24hr establishments.

1013;bipolarreddit;mrsmanicpanic;16/02/2018;"(Content Warning) Florida and Media Representation of Mental Illness Reading of the news of another mass casualty in the US yesterday was first heartbreaking, then infuriating.  Every news outlet I saw pointed toward the focus on mental illness.    POTUS went as far as saying that he wanted to tackle the complex problem of ""mental illness"". 

1) WTF does that mean?
Is he referring to ensuring that healthcare is readily available to Americans living with mental illnesses? Or that those who have mental illnesses will be receiving assistance in obtaining treatment?

2) Why is it that the only time people speak to mental health as an issue, as  a priority, is when a lot of people are dead? Why is the culpability always on mental illness and never on a negligent gun legislation? 

Here in Canada, we have a make shift day of awareness that has its own set of problems because it is funded by a corporation that doesn't respect the mental health of its own employees.   We're trying, but we do have basic mental health coverage and care that isn't always afforded elsewhere.

1014;bipolarreddit;Mrssomethingstarwars;28/01/2018;"Mania, Hypersexuality, Relationship, Mlehh... Ugh. I already typed like 3 paragraphs and it all disappeared. Anywho, as indicated, I'm experiencing my second manic episode in a four month period, despite meds. I'm not complaining! But what I'm getting at is that I'd appreciate if you just bear with me. TIA.

In my last manic episode, I expressed my hypersexuality by posting in GoneWild-essque subs. That's what I'm doing this time, but also selling content and it's just not enough for me. I want to meet some of these people I encounter and it all just seems so RATIONAL in my head. Like, not everyone is a serial killer, right? The only problem I see is my boyfriend, and that is obviously a bigger problem.

Ah, my boyfriend. He is amazing. I love him so much, I just want MORE. Like, I want to do the things I want to do and come out together at the end of this phase I'm going through. I've never had that kind of freedom before. I've steadily been in relationships for almost 10 years now and only been with two people in my life. So it seems fair to want to explore a bit, doesn't it? But I don't think it's fair that I'd have to sacrifice my relationship to do so. Ugh.

I really can't afford to be in this kind of a headspace. I'm starting college back up tomorrow and I love my life. I had a talk with my boyfriend though, and he said once he is comfortable with what I'm already doing, we can explore the idea of me having different experiences and such. So I wasn't shut down, so that's good. But I started to spiral because he asked if it's something I would risk our relationship for. And I explained that it feels like this is what it will take for me to be happy, and I don't think it's fair to leverage my happiness against our relationship so I couldn't answer... Is that bad?

What are your experiences with hypersexuality especially in regards to relationships? How do you get through it? How do I curb the appeal to just ""fuck it, yolo"" it?";1537;61;311;29;36;524;181;390

I got new insurance and was looking through the list of ""preventative"" medications, the ones covered at 100% and don't cost you anything, to see if anything I was taking was on the list.  (It never is, but always worth a check.)

First I searched depakote.  To my surprise it was listed, but as an epilepsy medication.  My first thought was whether or not they knew I wouldn't be taking it for epilepsy and I would get away with getting it for free!

Next I searched for Cymbalta, and it was there!  Listed as an antidepressant.  In fact they had nearly all your antidepressants on there.  Lithium is on the list and even some anti anxiety meds.

Sure enough, when I filled my prescriptions, they were free.

I mean it makes good business sense.  I am more expensive if I end up in the hospital.  Just like quitting smoking drugs are frequently covered because you're a lower risk if you quit.

For some reason it just made me feel good.  Like hey, it's just an illness and we know you need meds to keep it under control.  No big deal.  Or something.  It also made me very people for everyone under this plan because while I do not currently have any issues paying for my meds, I know what it's like to be in that position and it's horrible.

After struggling with severe depressive episodes throughout my life that have caused me to drop out of school, lose nearly all the jobs I've worked, ect. ect., (over 10 years of bullshit) I decided to get some proper medical help. 

Within first day I started taking the antidepressants I experienced a pretty significant shift in my mood. Energy, talking, felt good. Felt ""high"", I guess. I didn't get any sleep that night though, and for the next three days I don't know if I got any more than an hour of sleep a night. 

On each of those next days I felt like I was detached from my body a lot, like I was watching myself. I started pacing in my room a lot, and felt compelled to talk or else like... idk I felt like something bad would happen. I had no appetite, my mind was moving way to fast to focus on anything, let alone food. I was totally incapacitated by anxiety, and stayed in my apartment the whole time, where I feel like my roommates were all looking at me funny and put off by how weird I felt I was acting (which is funny because when I asked them about those few days they just told me I was reallly talkative but otherwise they weren't freaked out or anything). Weirdest experience was what felt like a stabbing/lightning sensation in my brain. I reallly don't know how to explain that one. In the end I started praying to God to relieve me of my suffering which was weird because I'm an athiest. 

I didn't take the antidepressants on the fifth day, and most of this stuff ceased shortly after, though I continued to not sleep very much (like 5 hours a night?) for a little while.

I didn't contact my doctor for a few months because I thought everything was fine. I suddenly started cutting and dying my own hair a lot, got multiple piercings and tattoos, jumped fair and doing all kinds of other kinda fun wreck-less shit (never done any of these things before). Drinking a lot and being really social. Started working out, got a dream job, started dating again, felt like my life was getting back in order.

Then I just sorta stopped. Real normal for a while.

Then the depression came back, lost my job, gaining weight, ect. and I went to my doctor to talk about it and of course all this came up, which lead to my diagnosis as BPII. Sure, I thing my experience was a bit out of the ordinary but it just doesn't sound like what you guys talk about when you talk about mania.";2047;75;392;32;35;655;252;500

I have a partner who struggles with depressive episodes, where he self-isolates and will completely disappear (meaning, will go to entirely different cities). He is on medication, is very consistent with taking it, and regularly attends counselling. He is so wonderful to actively work towards his goals, and uses this isolation as a way to not subject anyone to any pain that he may cause them.

I've been in a very suicidal depressive cycle for about two months now, and I'm just...stuck. I have some coping mechanisms that work for my usual level of depression, but nothing seems to be helping this time. 

I'm making sure I eat semi-regularly, taking my meds, getting sleep, and trying to keep myself distracted with old hobbies (even if they're not enjoyable, it does take my mind off things for a bit). I'm currently trying to get into meditation/mindfulness at the suggestion of my therapist but it's proving to be a bit difficult (so far I've used Headspace and Calm). A solid exercise schedule seems really daunting/near impossible right now, but I'm planning on taking my dog for a walk tomorrow if it doesn't rain.

Does anyone have anything that helped them get out of a severe depressive state?

I've been on a road getting off meds for a while now, with the doc's approval.  I got off some clonazepam and then moved on to Lamictal.  As I mentioned, I've gotten off things before, but this last one really has me freaked out.  It's been 5 weeks, and I'm still exhausted.  It's not every day, but most days, and I get dizzy still.  It just seems with everything else that I've gotten off of, that given some time, you have a slope effect of things generally getting better over time.  This is the first time where if it is the withdrawals, it doesn't seem to be getting better (as quickly as I would think) and kind of getting worse.  

I'm looking into other things, such as Lyme (which actually could be a possibility) but was wondering if anyone else had a case of a longer withdrawal time with Lamictal, or something that you thought was harder than you might have thought in the first place?  Or just any thoughts?  It's really dragging me down.  I'd really appreciate it, and hope that everyone is feeling well!

So, I'm definitely hypomanic right now but I feel like it's different somehow this time? I was diagnosed relatively recently, and this is the first time I'm actually cognizant of the mood shift. I'm slightly alarmed; it started where I was having trouble concentrating. That morphed into a sort of word-salad where it'd take me awhile to come up with words that were on the tip of my tongue, or I'd say the completely wrong word. (example as I just was typing this! ""Diagnosed relatively recently""--I had to stop and think how to phrase that because I wanted to type ""soon-ish"", but could not for the life of me remember the word ""relatively"".)

At work today and it's been rough. Well, that's an understatement. I feel like I'm literally having to corral my brain. Cannot concentrate AT ALL. Making really stupid mistakes. Fleeting thoughts I barely have time to even grab onto and process. 

My hypomanic espisodes usually come coupled with wild bursts of creativeness and wanting to do ALL THE THINGS, and I can't get to sleep and can't stay asleep. I've had no problem getting to sleep, but I feel like no matter how much or little sleep I get I'm exhausted? That usually happens when I'm depressed! I don't get it!

I'm currently doing my honours in Zoology which entails a research project. I have two supervisors: One of the professors at my uni and a postdoc whose research I will be elaborating on.  


It's a lot of work so far (writing up, going through literature, making proposals, etc.). I started this year off on a really bad foot and I've just been in a really low place for the whole of it. I'm type 2, so I'm either down or I'm REALLY down.

The static items regarding diet are fine, I don't want to get granular there, but for tracking the emotions I feel I need to better ""standardize"" what I am trying to say.  Has anyone encountered this?

For instance, I can have entries that range from ""feeling scattered"", ""feeling lost"", ""feeling confused"".  Well really this is me saying I am confused.  So I was thinking of focusing on Robert Plutchik's theory of 8 basic emotions and sort of seeing how that works for a while.

The reason for this is so I can trend the states over time and see if that uncovers anything.

After 3 years refusing to take a single pill, i accepted it. I take valproic acids. I have 0 side effects, 3 pills/day. So all goods !  


On the psy level, i feel more serene and the depression disapeared. I feel like i can see more clearly the things about my life. I dont feel this hole inside me anymore. I dont feel this deep sadness, its really weird to be free from this.  
But there is a second effect. My cynism level is rising sky rocket !  


I always been a cynic person with a touch of misanthropism. But now this is a new level of this. I dont see my friends anymore. I dont answer them when they call. To be honnest, i just dont see the point. Before, when i felt lonely and depressed, i needed them to keep my mind busy and dont let the negavity take the control. Now ? Whats the point ?   
I evolve in a particular social environment. Wealthy artist people... And now i realize that i dont really like them.   


Also, the sadness disappeared but i feel 100% lost in life. In a world where wealth, fame, possession seems to be everything i give absolutely no value to this. To be honnest i dont even know what is valuable. Yes well, virtue, honor, compassion, heart are valuable values to me but its just an utopia in this world. I just feel like there is no point to even try to exist in this world. I'm not interested in making a family, not interested in money. As soon as it comes to money i lose all interest in something. The egyptians were buried with their possessions and we are the witness of what it becomes. So whats the point ?   


Thats my major problem. I thought it was depression. But i think its just myself. I just feel like the modern society is wrong about everything. Like if we missed the purpose of our existence.   


I remember when i was a kid i watched on tv a report about a temple in Thailand for drugs addicts reability called Tham Krabok. And there was that man, an  ex us soldier of fortune who went there to overcome a alcohol addiction. After his rehab he stayed there and became a monk. He died recently after dedicating 30 years of his life to this temple. That is a great life. That is what life should be about. In my opinion ofc.   


So, all that to say that yes i'm bipolar. Never experienced high psychotic episode. My episode are soft. Just compulsive needs to buy thing to overcome emptyness. Sexual urge and needs. Planing big things but i still quite about it, i never talk about that to people as i remember that its not normal. But the reality will still disappoint me. Without or with medication....

1077;bipolarreddit;ohsovogue;27/02/2019;"Doctor is forcing me to come off Depakote because I am a 'woman of childbearing age'. She knows I have an IUD and do not want kids but insists despite my protests. I feel totally enraged and dehumanised. I have recently moved back to the UK (specifically London) after having attended university in the US. This is important because the two countries have different rules regarding prescription medications. It was in the US that I received my bipolar diagnosis and started treatment. When I first moved back my GP was happy to renew all my prescriptions from the US, so I do currently have enough Depakote to last me a few months, but he also referred me to a new psychiatrist. I met with her for the first time yesterday and she said that in the UK, they do not prescribe Depakote to women of childbearing age because it can cause birth defects and she would not be able to keep me on as a patient if I were to continue to take it. I'm on a lot of medications for a multitude of health conditions and it took months of painful trial and error to find a drug for bipolar that didn't give me unbearable side effects and also played nice with my other medications. Finally finding Depakote was the best thing that happened to me. I really don't want to go through the pain of finding a new drug all over again. Especially as I've recently been through some trauma (coming out of an emotionally abusive relationship), and am worried how the instability of coming off and on medications might impact me.   


What makes me the most angry about all of this, is that this would not be an issue if I were a man. I do not want kids and of this I have been certain since I was a child. I have an IUD in place, the most effective form of birth control, and moreover since breaking up with my ex I have only dated women (I'm bisexual) so I don't foresee an unplanned pregnancy occurring in the near future. My psychiatrist knows all of this but apparently at 25 I am too young to know what I want or have agency over my own body and my mental health is less important than the wants of some hypothetical future baby-wanting husband. I feel truly disgusted, like I've been reduced to a walking womb. I desperately wanted to scream at her but I need to hold out at least for one more appointment because I'm almost out of Ritalin (also have ADHD) and she's the only doctor I can get in to see and prescribe it before I run out.  


She was deliberately vague about what the 'rules' are surrounding this and if another psychiatrist would be allowed to prescribe it to me or not. My pharmacist certainly had no issues giving it to me after I said I had an IUD. Has anyone else been through this and know what the rules are? Anyone on here a woman in the UK who has successfully been prescribed Depakote? If anyone has a London (ideally zone 1/2) based psych that does will you message me their name (private sector doc is fine)? I'm really at a loss of what to do but I feel like she's not the right psychiatrist for me long term if she's so rigid about these antiquated, sexist standards. ";2441;104;443;55;32;816;266;589
1078;bipolarreddit;Ok_Expert;15/04/2018;"bipolar &amp; traveling &amp; manic episodes &amp; foreign psych ward !! Hi everyone. I wrote this about something I experienced last night/kind of what happened to me in my first psychotic manic episode or whatever you wanna call it. Did anyone else ever experience something like this? 




The sun was setting in the Guatemalan Western Highlands as I used some of my precious battery life to check how far I was on the map on my phone. Nearly three hours. 

Traffic had slowed to a crawl, and I felt the tell-tale ticking of my anxiety rising in my stomach. 

This wasn’t the plan, my brain told me. It was supposed to still be light when you got there. 

Fear began to overwhelm me even though I had been in situations like this before. I had arrived only the night earlier in Guatemala City close to midnight. It’s days like this my recent diagnosis as being bipolar began to make sense. 

I thought I heard the woman with her child talking on the phone on the bus saying something about “rubia,” and fright overwhelmed me. I have become so scared of my own brain. In everything I do, I question – what symptom of bipolarity is this? 

While in Croatia last summer, I was relaxed, partying, and feeling like for once, I had come out of my shell; I had become the person I was supposed to be. 

That bout of mania landed me in a Croatian psych ward. When I stopped punishing myself for the sexual assault I suffered when I was four and began to allow myself to be happy, or so I thought, I had a psychotic break. 

I heard people talking about me. 

First, it was about how great I was, how cool, how pretty, and it was flattering. I felt on top of the world. Then, I heard the other hallucinations. 

They were not so flattering. 

I spent a night in a hostel crying, while nearly 10 people in the same room tried to sleep. I felt terrible, but I couldn’t stop crying. I was hysterical. 

My hallucinations had made me believe I had been raped, I had herpes, I was tainted and disgusting, and that I should probably kill myself because no one loved or cared about me. 

That night, I spent in my head. I didn’t sleep, except for an hour, but then I was woken up by the hostel staff and asked to leave – my reservation was only for one night. I wandered around the city and I felt like everyone was talking about me. I wanted to cry or sleep or escape, but I just didn’t have the mental capacity to do any of it. 

I muttered and wandered. I felt so foggy, like there was a weight on my mind. Why were people following me? Why couldn’t I see them? 

The next two days are kind of blurs in my mind, but I know I managed to leave all my belongings behind, including my glasses and my ability to see, have a delusion that I could speak every language I had ever heard a word of, and start to become aggressive. 

The next clear memory I have, I was waking up in a soft, warm bed. It was dirty all around me, and I felt so groggy and tired. I was in and out of sleep the whole day, waking up occasionally to eat a meal. There was a layer of grime and shame on me that a cold shower couldn’t get off. All I wanted to do was curl up in that bed and become an invalid. The delusions were still there, but weaker.

So, when this perfectly friendly, normal Guatemalan woman was simply having a conversation with her mother, and I thought I heard words that might pertain to me, it freaked me out.  

I have a mantra I internalize when I am projecting my fears onto speech around me – no one cares about you, no one is talking about you. 

It sounds pretty emo. 

But, when I thought, just for two minutes, this Guatemalan woman was planning a way to rob me, it’s extremely comforting. 

I went home after I ended up in the psych ward because clearly I needed to meet with psychiatrists and a whole host of doctors and a lovely therapist who would try to help me and have varying levels of success. 

Throughout this process, my goal was to continue to travel by myself. I saw this as a hiccup. A pretty major hiccup, but one that’s able to be overcome with a can-do attitude! 

It wasn’t about or feeling like I had failed, but an urging from deep in my motherfucking soul that told me if I stayed in the relative warmth and comfort of my parents’ house now, I would never leave. 

That’s probably a symptom.

1079;bipolarreddit;Okay_then_now_what;21/03/2019;"Neuroscience of bipolar I am a total hopless nerd. What helps me probably the most with bipolar (besides meds, duh) is understanding what the medications actually do. I have binders full of detailed notes I take on different classes of psychopharmaceuticals (Its so fascinating how people with different brain chemistries react so differently to various meds!). For some reason the chemical perspective helps me understand it all SO much better. It also helps to explain it to normies, I've found! And with work I've done on emotional awareness it feels like I can tell when something is emotional versus caused by brain chemicals (Of course there is overlap).

After things like exercise, sex, caffeine, anything that gets them neurotransmitters moving I feel hyper aware of my chemical state. I can feel the the fall and the rise. 

...it's just when I let my chemicals get so off balance that I get manic or depressed and then this logical view is fucked. Lol.

This was kind of random, but it consumes a lot of my thoughts! Are there any other bipolar science nerds out there?  Any thoughts? Or do you have certain scientific perspectives that help you understand this illness?

HOWEVER, I was blessed with the laziest coworkers ever. I have only been there 4 weeks, and I’ll be juggling 10-12 tables all by myself because people just don’t want to do their work. I do this while maintaining all the little tasks such as replenishing ice, making drinks, running food, cleaning tables. I have no problem doing it and do it with a smile, but it puts me under a lot of stress and it can get frustrating. Managers say it’s a work in progress but I’ve yet to see any kind of improvement. 

I’m fairly new to my diagnoses as well, I’m still learning how I function and what sets me off and how to work through the highs and lows. I recently discovered a new issue though. If someone comes at me, I get into a fight or flight kind of mode. I used to be a snazzy biatch and tell people to pound sand, but now my brain completely shuts down and I cry and try to runaway. I AM NOT USUALLY A CRIER OR A RUNNER. EVER. 

The incident that set me off last night was charging my friends card for $200 instead of $50 (he was cool and we fixed it) and then I had a coworker coming at me for not bussing HER table right away. She threw a glass at me, and yelled at me in front of 20+ people. To add to the embarrassment I had customers coming up to me asking me if I was okay. I wasn’t and I went from a high to a low, so I told my managers I needed to dip. 

Whatever, that little scene she caused was, messed me up. I drove 100+ all the way home, not caring what happened and I’ve been in bed since then. I have to return to work today and I really have no idea how to handle the situation. My managers were understanding, but how do I face everyone after they’ve seen me at my worst? I’ve also never had an episode happen in public, or experienced a high and a low within the same 15 minutes. So I guess my questions are, how do I handle it? How do I go back to work? And what do I say? And how do I get these feelings under control before they turn into a big problem? These are things I need to be able to control to be in a successful work environment and it’s something that I’m really struggling with.

Dear _______,

Here you are again. You've been dragged kicking and screaming into the darkness, the abyss, the place where there is only one way out. You barely eat, lie in bed all day but hardly sleep. Ordinary tasks have become insurmountable. Even your bed to which you have been bound is no safe haven. Ideation and contemplation have reared their ugly heads. 

Clear your mind of these terrible thoughts for now. Remember that you have been here before. Don't forget what you have learned. Depression is not your enemy! You are mistaken. This immense weight you carry with you, though debilitating now, is a blessing in disguise. It is a badge of honor, a shield that covers you from head to toe. Take comfort in the fact that you can persevere and survive this as you have done before. And when you leave this place, don't forget to take the shield with you. With it you will find peace in knowing that you withstand anything, because you have been to the worst place imaginable... and survived to write this.";1040;35;192;15;21;313;137;243

1097;bipolarreddit;overdramaticteen;06/01/2018;"Can you be manic with low self-esteem? (tw suicide) Hey everyone,

I just spent a night in a psychiatric assessment unit. Before admitting myself, I hadn’t slept in 90 hours, not because I couldn’t, but because I didn’t feel like I should. I wanted to keep “being productive” which is interesting because I was also too anxious to do things that I actually need to do (reply to emails and texts, do work, self-care and hygiene). This resulted in three terrible nights of organizing parts of my room, drinking, cutting, exercising, writing, and beating my Tetris high score. I created more art and wrote more than I ever have in such short period of time. I kept making plans with friends, setting goals, etc while fully conscious that I would be too emotionally drained to do any of them the next day, which just lead to disappointment. The whole time I was awake, I was surging with adrenaline and didn’t feel tired. I wasn’t getting hallucinations or feeling sluggish like most people report after not sleeping for 3 days. This was especially strange because I usually feel tired after a normal 8 hours of sleep due to low iron, plus I was only eating ~500 cal a day. Instead, I felt alert and was able to do math homework, write, go to work, etc. One weird thing was that my train of thought was totally off..one second I would think “I’m getting out of the bath in two minutes” and immediately follow that with “what am I doing in two minutes?” or I’d be surfing reddit, see a recommended website, open a new tab, then forget what I was doing. 

The second night I was awake, I had this really strong urge to kill myself for about two hours (very different from my normal passive “I want to die” thoughts; this was like a primal irrational urge) and I then spent the rest of the day totally out of it, like my brain was in a different place. I immediately forgot the details of those two hours after they happened so I can’t even really describe it in detail. 

This whole not-sleeping episode came right after a few months of feeling extremely depressed, unable to perform basic activities or care for myself, too anxious to go out or go to classes.

Anyways, all that to say that I met with a psychiatrist while I was in the unit, and she was considering the possibility of bipolar disorder (I am already diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression). Bipolar disorder is not something I have ever considered before. She was worried about putting me back on antidepressants in case it triggered more mania. What held her back was that generally you should feel an inflated self-esteem during manic episodes, but I didn’t feel that at all. I hated myself and felt more suicidal than ever before. 

So my question is: is anyone here bipolar and feels low self-esteem during manic episodes? Is this possible? As a 17 year old going off to uni next year, GAD and depression are already enough to deal with…I truly hope I do not have BD. But if I do I’d like to figure it out ASAP so I can start getting it under control. Thanks for any help!";2414;101;421;48;31;789;281;570

1108;bipolarreddit;panflet;29/03/2018;"Doubting my BPII Diagnosis, Apprehensive About Meds, Feeling Like a Fake **TL;DR: I’m afraid that I was never hypomanic in the first place and it was all in my head (“Labelling Theory”), my current medication while effective is dulling my moods/cognition/memory and could be dangerous to keep taking in the long-term if I’m not really bipolar, and I don’t know what to do.**


I’ll preface this by saying that I’m not seeking medical advice or re-diagnosis, just venting and looking for general advice or shared experiences from people who know they have bipolar. I don’t feel comfortable opening up to my therapist about this because she doesn’t believe me, and I have a strained/weird relationship with my psych. Apologies in advance for the wall of text.

 
So history. I was initially diagnosed with MDD in late high school (but had recurring episodes since age 13), put on Zoloft, and once I titrated up on a higher dose I started to feel restless and hyper to the point where I wondered if those were side effects. So I googled and found out what hypomania was. Even though a lot of the symptoms were similar, what I was experiencing wasn’t as harmful or destructive. I also did not experience the two suspected episodes for very long, maybe 4-5 days TOPS. 


In fact, I was very productive and somehow ended up doing paid work for this relatively well-known animator/illustrator on the internet that I would’ve otherwise never dared to message out of the blue. So I wasn’t too concerned. It was psychomotor agitation and racing thoughts that made me uncomfortable, but those aren’t exclusive to hypomania. Other stuff happened but I don’t want to write a laundry list of symptoms/actions.
 

But then I saw things like, “Even if you have the slightest concern, it can turn into full-blown mania!! Especially if you have a bipolar relative!!” and my anxiety kicked in. I stopped seeing my psych (for unrelated reasons) and cut off my meds. Then something traumatic happened which triggered a year+ long depression. So I got a new psych that diagnosed me as BP2.
 

However, in retrospect, I’m wondering if I exaggerated my “hypomanic” symptoms and made myself believe I experienced it after researching it. What if that “euphoria” was really just the happiness from getting out of a depression and accomplishing new things in life? I got second opinions from other professionals who disagree with my psych and suggested ADHD, dysthymia, or even a vague “personality disorder” (big NO for the latter). So I’m confused.
 

It’s been a year since I’ve been on medication (Lamictal and Klonopin) and I’ve been tracking my moods on Daylio. Aside from good days, bad days, and occasional day-long “blips” of intense moods, it’s so… purple. Neutral. But I’m functioning well! I’m so glad that I have not been suicidal for so long, but it feels as though my emotions have been dulled or flattened. Happiness is just mild contentment. Seeing other people cry at a funeral without being able to feel their pain feels so uncomfortable. If I were truly bipolar I would have definitely had at least one hypomanic episode by now but it hasn’t happened. With these meds, I also get “brain fog” every once in a while and I feel that my memory is much poorer.
 

I was actually thinking of switching to another psych (I live far from my current one and my mother hates her) so that I can explain my situation and try something different. But if my current medications are working to an extent is it worth it? If I’m not actually bipolar, staying on this medication for the long-term might do more harm to my body than good. No matter how you look at it, all of this is risky.


Does anyone have any personal experience that is similar to this? Thoughts or advice?";2975;148;500;83;49;983;325;681

It's usually treated with the same meds they use for epilepsy.  The perfect way to not freak people out if you have  to tell them you are bipolar. ""Kaksisuuntainen mielialahäiriö"", means  Bipolar in Finnish. No one I know understands Finnish and no one gives a  shit enough to actually look it up. So everything in the title is  technically true but it doesn't immediately invoke fear and prejudice.

I'd like to introduce [My brand new subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/). As someone from the UK who has dealt with mental health issues for years, I've noticed a lack of active UK spaces and would like to try and change that if there is the demand for it. Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out due to uneven population. I'm hoping it can be a sub where people can either ask questions, give support, vent or promote their own blogs or work if related to mental health/therapy. My inbox is always open too!

1114;bipolarreddit;ParticularLaw;17/02/2018;"Unsure if I'm bipolar/borderline/neither... I know no one can make a diagnosis except a doctor, but I was just wondering what others experiences are. I have been on mood stabilizers for about 2 months now. They have really seemed to help me, and I have been practicing meditation/DBT/mindfulness(which goes along with the DBT).

I was diagnosed as bipolar in December when I was baker acted in late November because I was contemplating suicide. Okay, I've been missing my medications, and I've been contemplating going out and doing drugs and having sex; I'm also extremely irritable, and I just want to push people out of my life. I can't stop thinking about these two guys I have a crush on, and I almost want them to stop talking to me by messaging them to delete me from their phones/ off their messaging apps etc. I've done this kind of stuff all my life; well since I was a teenager (I'm 25 now)... I'd just randomly push people away(mostly guys I'd have a crush on)... It's like I was upset with myself for thinking about them so much, and I figured the only way to make it stop was to push them away, but I'd almost regret it afterwards. When it came to female friends I'd just disappear on them for months at a time. Also, I'd have impulse control issues during these phases, but it would only come on randomly like spending money, overeating, sex, drugs, drinking, etc. 

It's weird because in daily life most people would never guess I have these issues since I'm really nice, and I try to keep these problems to myself and my mom and my therapist. Right now though I'm feeling all the urges associated with my manic episodes, and I'm not sure what to do. I started taking my medicine tonight, so I'm hoping it will help. I'm on Lamictal and Trileptal if anyone is interested... Does this sound familiar to anyone else?  I know all experiences are different, but I've asked other friends and family members before if they ever have these type of experiences and they just look at me like I'm crazy.

1120;bipolarreddit;peachpitiful;08/03/2019;"Anyone else desperately searching for people to bring new ""adventures"" My last hypomanic episode, I met a guy off tinder and we spent pretty much 2 months together everyday. Everyday was a new adventure, lots of alcohol, house parties, clubs, gigs, meeting friends, 4 am walks. So many new environments and experiences, and we pretty much left the house for 14 hours a day and wandered around. And it wasn't all alcohol. Just walking around the streets for hours, talking to new people, watching a new film, going to a new cafe all in a day. Sadly it ended sour. And of course it's not really a healthy way to live. But it felt great to have someone who matched my energy in that state.

I'm now coming out of a depressive episode. I don't know what I am right now, but I am longing for someone to sweep me off my feet and have a 7 day bender with me. I'm this close to redownloading tinder and going out with anyone. As awful as it sounds, I don't even really want to hang out with my existing friends like this. I specifically want someone new, and someone who's going to spend an unhealthy amount of time with me and probably kill their liver with alcohol. I don't know, it just seems more exciting? The idea of watching TV with a friend feels like a band aid. I can't be quiet. I want to dance! I may be in my PJs but if someone I didn't really know invited me.... anywhere right now, I would jump out of bed.

Previously I was missed diagnosed with depression and general anxiety. I’ve been on and off the same medication since I was 16. It’s currently not working so I’ve had to take a break again to try something new. I’m currently coming out of this depression part of my cycle. Usually the hypomania comes next because I’m so stressed out about how hard I fucked up whatever happened in the 3/4 weeks of depression. I struggle a lot with trying to cope self harm. I use to cut for almost two years when I was in high school, which was be main reason I got on medication to begin with. Throughout the years (16-21) I’ve gone on a few binders. When I was younger it was MDMA &amp; alcohol, when I became older it was alcohol. But was all stopped by the fact that I was pregnant. My kids have been the only reason why I haven’t slipped back into drugs or alcohol. I’m currently in outpatient treatment, I guess you would call it that. I go see two doctors to talk and sort out my feelings and try and find a program fitting for me. This has been the hardest fight of my life. I thought this was over but after I had my son it creeped right back for revenge. I had him in 2016 and I’ve basically missed half of his life because I don’t remember from being so depressed or my anxiety.

I wish I could have given them a better start, or a better life currently. I have a job interview Wednesday, on Valentine’s Day. This is the first job I’ve gone to since October when I tried to kill myself. I left a job after one orientation because it was a trigger to me basically.

HLA 1 and 2 mthfr mutations. Suicidal last summer and out of work for 2 months. 25 mgs of lamotrigine REALLY  helped me. I survived an itchy,  scary rash, which is now quiescent, but my hair started falling out (mostly on top and at the temples, giving me a Draculinuan hairline) at 50 mgs. I had a radical, fast response to the lamo, but since a shaved head at my age is not a good look, had to back off. Some loss still at 25.

The biggest irony of the lamo experience is that I suspect if I were to keep taking it, I could have found a way to live with the hair situation. I cannot afford a good wig. I make 16.00 an hour. I have no self esteem to draw upon in this regard, so my NP okayed me to drop it and start trileptal, which she said might work for me like lamo seemed to.

We are highly focused and streamlined, yet loose and flexible (effortless effort being the motto). Our basic aim-quintessence is to harness all available energies to create an interdimensional rift/gate to haven that can propel us to 5th dimension and beyond while still connected to Earth but ultimately undergoing physical transfiguration, also fueled by the bowels of the earth likewise (as above so below)- which constructs a beastly cyclotron that irons out certain unwanted specific frequency-sets, diminishes their influence on the collective.

&amp;#x200B;

""As soon as humanity unites on this planet, it will qualify to establish contact with other more advanced civilizations, such as the Agarthans and those from the GF. In fact the Agarthans and some ascended masters such as St. Germain will already help us run the cities of light and the numerous healing centres which will manifest very soon all over the globe. The next step will be visiting other civilizations, but this could only happen after the incarnated human personality has completed the LBP and has ascended at least to 5D by transfiguring from a carbon-based body into crystalline light body.""

The three cities of light will be open portals to the multiverse and to numerous advanced humanoid, and later on, other civilisations, such as the dragons. Alone this fact will make the existence of national states and nations obsolete as all the people will recognize their multidimensional nature and will strive to ascend too and be able to live in these cities of light and enjoy the advantages of a higher dimensional life. In the first place, they will enjoy the healing possibilities there which will help all humans advance rapidly in their LBP and also ascend.

Now, all of the other beings from the other star systems that are connecting with you all through the various channels that you have there on Earth are doing the same thing.

""We are excited to witness the coming together of humanity and the Arcturian beings that you will be meeting in the flesh.

1135;bipolarreddit;pickleb1tch;08/03/2019;"Hypomania and False Hope r/Bipolar: “Is there anyone present who is making their first post or has been diagnosed in the last 30 days? If so, please introduce yourself.” 

Me: *stands up* Hey everyone, I’m pickleb1tch, and I have been diagnosed with bipolar 2. I’ve been trying to manage, but it’s getting hard. I’m on meds, but they’re being adjusted and that’s a process. 

I used to love my hypomania. With the small caveat of mild insomnia, loss of appetite, and wanting to do everything at once thus getting nothing done, it’s a pretty good time. The world seems beautiful and I feel euphoric. I become more creative and productive. Being around people makes me happy and I seek company. Conversations become more meaningful and memorable. 

Lately, I feel as if being hypomanic contributed to me doing things “normal” me wouldn’t do. Hypomania let me feel capable and as if I mattered a bit more than I did. Think very mild delusions. Among the things I wouldn’t normally do: A friend (A) had confided in me about troubles regarding her friend (B). I hadn’t been present in either of their lives for almost 2 years for various reasons. So I went ahead and made a long but gentle text to B about maybe considering talking to a professional about problems A mentioned - without telling A that I texted B. A texted me, clearly upset, and I hadn’t grasped the gravity or the sensitivity of the topic. It was something between the two of them and I had breached their trust. I was way out of line. I had been absent for 2 years and thought I could butt in and fix things like a glowing ethereal fairy whose words of wisdom would magically make all things well. I thought I had a connection with them that had clearly been far weaker than I perceived, but thought I was doing a good thing. Writing that text felt like I was genuinely helping, like it would change things: more so than I normally would and looking back at the text I sent to B makes my insides curdle. Like Reggae says, “it wasn’t me”.

You might think “ok, it’s just one text to your friends what’s the big deal?” For me, a lot was at stake. I hadn’t been there for a long while and was still testing the waters. I had no friends when I came back, and I desperately needed friends. It felt like I kinda had to make good impressions else I’d lose them forever. 

I know this is super mild compared to the severity of others’ mania, but for me it’s new and scary. When I realized what I had done with some semblance of sanity, I just sobbed and screamed in the car for this to “go away, leave me alone, make it stop.”

So please, if you’ve made it this far, a bit of advice about grounding yourself during mania would be greatly appreciated. ";2121;86;408;40;44;679;251;517

1137;bipolarreddit;Pickles_McBeef;07/04/2019;"Overanalyzing...or not 41/f, diagnosed 18 months ago, not sure if 1 or 2.

I broke up with my bf of nearly two years 2 months ago. When we first got together I was not diagnosed. We fought a lot and nearly broke up twice (due to my impulsivity) before I was diagnosed. I started meds and definitely felt better but we still fought a lot and I still felt impulses to break up, but never argued or acted on it. I also have GAD. Being on an SSRI is what lead to my diagnosis because it made me manic. I've tried Buspar but it didn't help at all, so I just do my best to cope with it. 

Ex-bf has ADD, anxiety, and depression and smokes large amounts of pot to cope. Hates pharmaceuticals and therapy. He was not supportive of me starting meds and thought pot was all I needed. Didn't like me going to therapy because I should be going to him, my partner, with my troubles.

He was intolerable when he wasn't high. Sweet as could be when he was, which was most of the time. When he'd run out and couldn't get any, I'd be on eggshells. 

He ran out and was incredibly irritable and said something very painful and I was crushed. I thought about it for about half an hour and then broke up with him. For a couple of weeks after the breakup I was sure it was impulsivity and I'd made a huge mistake because regardless of his flaws, I still love him.

Now that I'm two months out, my constant sky high anxiety while with him is now quite manageable. I'm eating better, exercising (which I quit when I was with him), reclaiming my social life, restarted therapy, and generally feel much better. I don't think I made a mistake because the thought of getting back together is not attractive at all.

But what all of this boils down to is, what part of all this is me, and what part is the disease? Was it sheer impulse that lead me to leave, or was I just unable to deal with his crap anymore? Is the energy I feel hypomania or is it just getting my life in order? And if it's the disease...how can anyone deal with this long term? It's exhausting. 

I want another relationship. Not right now, I've no interest in dating and want to get some debt paid down before I meet anyone, debt NOT incurred by impulse spending. But sometime down the road I do. I don't know how people deal with BP in their partner. I don't even know how to broach it with someone. I know my actions early in my relationship with my ex hurt him, and I feel deep regret for that. I know living with me was really hard on him and I fear doing that to another person. 

If you've read all this, thanks for ""listening."" I'm not sure if I'm looking at things objectively. I try, but I just don't know.";2062;72;437;39;44;694;228;536

1148;bipolarreddit;pipette_on;09/04/2019;"Stability and the fear of “what if” I had a major depressive episode in the winter of last year and it had taken me almost a full year to reach stability again, or maybe for the first time.  It wasn’t until I had this episode that I was treated for bipolar II after a partial hospitalization and a more intense inquiry of my symptoms.  I was prescribed mood stabilizers and an antipsychotic for the first time, and I can truly say I now know what stability feels like.  So much so that I sometimes wonder if I can still identify with others on this sub. 

It’s days like today though that I get the sinking feeling of “what if it’s happening again”.  After a conversation with my mom, she pointed how agitated and combative I was being and I realized over yesterday and today that I’ve been cocky, agitated, and jittery.   I also realized that the weather just turned where I live and all these things are the early signs of a hypomanic episode for me and I can’t help but get hit with the fear of “am I ramping up again? Is it going to happen? What will happen to my job if I have an episode? What does it mean for my treatment if it doesn’t work?”  

I know that I’m most likely fine but the sudden fear just makes me realize that no matter how stable I feel, I always need to keep an eye out for the future.  I don’t think we will ever be free as we need to be ever vigilant for bipolar to rear its ugly head again.";1108;39;221;19;20;375;150;283

In 2017, I was told that they have misdiagnosed me and I am bipolar with insomnia and anxiety. I was told that my medication is very important to keep me regulated and without it could be dangerous for my life. I refuse to take the medication because of the feeling zoned out like a zombie, incapacitated and no ambition. The breakup I experienced in 2017 seemed to have an impact on my mental health causing me to have rages of anger and outbursts verbally and physically (breaking things, throwing and punching anything). Recently, I have been going through overwhelming troubling events that caused me to lose everything, facing homelessness, out of my control, no family support, no job, no money, pushed away friends, and no where to go. The person that I've been dating could relate to having bipolar and understand, but I managed to destroy it. Rages are heightened and outburst increasing. I've done something that brought me so much shame, embarrassment and shock. Two days ago on Instagram, I uploaded seven videos of me and in those videos I was having a manic tantrum attack. At that moment and in the mindset I was in didn't realize that I just showed my mental illness for the world to see, I just snapped. My inbox and notifications were sounding off rapidly like a person ring the doorbell. I snapped out of that trans and watched the videos and I  immediately removed them. I turned my phone off for the day. Throughout the day my mania were in and out and I haven't slept since that day.  Well this is who I am and wanted to share. Thanks!";1368;66;224;30;23;432;172;306

1160;bipolarreddit;poofpuppa;08/01/2018;"Don’t know if I have Borderline Personality Disorder or Bipolar? Sorry if my this doesn’t come out properly, I feel sometimes as if I have so many Things to say, but I don’t know exactly what it is to say. This is mostly a venting. 


When I was a kid, I was diagnosed with Depression. I’ve mostly felt depressed my entire life due to emotional, physical and sexual abuse growing up. I was always tired, fatigued, I could barely get up in the morning and do things as simple as brushing my hair, taking a shower, eating, etc. 

After I got married, whenever my husband and I would get into arguments, I would feel so overwhelmed with emotions that I would scream and start to hit him, it literally felt like my mind was going to burst, and sometimes I would place my hands on my head to keep my thoughts from blowing up. But then when I would blow up, I would start screaming and hitting things without any discernible purpose. 

We just thought I was just an overly emotional person, because we never assumed anything was wrong other than my depression. So we went through several years of that, until a few years ago, I had an emotional affair with someone that literally seemed it came out of NOWHERE. At that time We started going to a doctor for depression where he also diagnosed me with bipolar depression(?), and anxiety. and then prescribed me, vibryyd, then lamictol, trileptol, Zoloft, Gabpentin, (sorry for the spelling) and then finally Wellbutrin. (Not all at the same time just in a period of a year) I also went to a therapist who told me to pretty much divorce my husband and at that time I felt like that was the greatest thing to do, so I went through with it up until the paperwork, and then suddenly decided I didn’t want to go through with it. Around that time I also stopped my affair extremely abruptly; it felt like I literally woke up one day and didn’t want anything to do with that person and situation. Throughout all this time, I’ve had about 15 jobs, either quitting or being fired. I would be really happy for months, I would be excellent at my job, then suddenly I felt like doing nothing, I would lose complete interest and that showed in my quality of work. There was also a point where I drank heavily when I had the affair, to the point where I would be drunk everyday. That feeling to get drunk did go away just as quickly as the feeling to have the affair did as well. 

Thankfully my husband and I got through it all, he forgave me and I’ve been extremely consistent with my medicine and trying to make things as easy as possible for my mental health. 

My doctor at that time prescribed me Xanax for my anxiety with did not help AT ALL. It made me feel like hell. If I took it and didn’t fall asleep immediately after, my body and bones would feel like they were shaking, and my mind felt like everything was sped up even more. This caused me to jump in front of oncoming traffic to kill myself because the pain was just so bad. I wasn’t harmed thankfully, but I did get baker acted until I weaned my self off the Xanax, which was an incredibly low dose, if I remember correctly. I also put on 20 pound during this time which worsened my depression. 

After all this, my doctor took me off Xanax, and lamictol, and just kept me on a new medicine, Wellbutrin CL (300mg) I felt GREAT. I suddenly had all the energy in the world, and was able to get up and do things! I did have some depressive days, but they went away fairly quickly. I was really happy, I thought I found the medicine for me! But it stopped working, I got more depressed and at the same time, I found myself getting More and more irritable, my emotions blew up again, I couldn’t have arguments without screaming in a rage and hitting myself or my husband, and my anxiety was getting worse to the point of being angry and irritated all the time. 

Instead of going back to the doctor, we found a new one and he pretty much told me that my old doctor was just treating my depression while my bipolar disorder was not in check. So he decreased my Wellbutrin to 150mg and gave me back my lamictol and added 25mg of seroquel as a sleep aid. 

I’m happy that this doctor is really trying to fix what the last doctor messed up, but my concern now is that, what if I just have Borderline personality disorder instead? Someone told me that those people have REALLY intense emotions, which is what I feel now, but I don’t want to diagnose myself, when the doctor already told me I have bipolar disorder. I just have a lot of distrust if that makes sense. Also this seroquel makes me so drowsy, I sleep 12+ hours and all day I feel this grogginess like a zombie almost and I’ve only been at 50 mg- 25mg. I feel calm and relaxed but it feels like my body is so slow. So I’m just worried that this medicine isn’t really for me and just another med that will make me lose my mind. I just don’t know what to feel or if I’m bipolar or just depressed and all this makes my head spin and Feel even more hopeless. ";3936;161;743;74;47;1276;336;966

This might tap into a more philosophical topic, but I can't tell the difference between my actual emotions and my mental disorder. Being BP2, its hard to tell whether I'm actually motivated and happy for once rather than hypomanic. The depressive episodes are easy to tell apart from reasonable sadness because I've suffered from severe depression (before my BP symptoms manifested) so I can tell the signs more easily. But with mania, I just don't know. 

I can never tell when I'm actually getting better or if I'm just being hypomanic.

We dated for 2 years. Before we got together she was in a manic episode and then afterwards we got together. At this point I didn't even know that she was bipolar. She had social anxiety, schizophrenia and depressions, the same as me, so we worked perfectly together. We would sit at home, playing videogames and were just enjoying the company of the other person. 

Then her life changed. She finally found the motivation to get into a new class and I think this is what triggered the manic episode. She was suddenly a complete other person, she spent like 1000$ (all she had) on creative things and new hobbies. She was really outgoing, which I wasn't used to at all. And then it happened. She met with another guy. Then she met a second time with him. Until then I just thought she is finally making friends, but then she cancelled a date with me to go out partying with the guy and another friend of hers. That was the moment I realised something was seriously wrong. We had a talk. She didn't cheat, but she also made it pretty clear that she does not want the relationship anymore. I asked her why and she couldn't even give me an answer. She tried to explain it by ""feeling like she is trapped in a cage."" and I first thought that she meant she wants sex with other guys, but no. She told me she misses the time from before the relationship (her last manic episode). And yes I know that it sounds like she cheated, but she didn't, I know this for a fact.

Even more things happened. She proposed the idea of a 1 month relationship break (without cheating). I agreed. And I think that was the time where the manic episode manifested itself completely.

After 1 month I texted her and her response clearly showed me that there is no spark of common sense left in her. She didn't care about anything anymore. She straight up told me that she knew 3 weeks ago already that it won't work. She told me she is currently at a restaurant with another guy and she will bring him with her later to pick up her stuff. When she arrived she had completely new clothes, a new haircut, tons of make-up.

BUT I also knew that she did not do any of this to hurt me. It was pretty obvious that she didn't really have a clue what her actions did anymore. It was almost like a child that just wants to have fun and that doesn't even realise how his actions affect other people.

1 week later I visited her parents to get back my stuff and they just cried and told me they don't know what's wrong with her and that she is behaving really weirdly lately.

So now my questions for you guys : What will happen once her manic episode is over ? Will she feel regret and shame ? And what can I do to prevent that ? She tried to commit suicide multiple times in the past and I'm almost sure that once she realises what she has done, that she will do it again. And the last times I was there for her, but I'm scared that she is too ashamed to contact me this time. After the break up I texted her that she can contact me anytime, but I'm not sure if she will do it. I mean, what happens to you guys once the manic episode is over ? And especially what happens when the manic episode started like this ?";2668;100;533;39;53;842;263;664

I'm not too too torn up about it, because hey, I don't have a full time job, and sometimes it's fun. But predictably, some days I end up not being able to clean. And it gets messy, real fast---especially the dishes, which I hate doing, doubly so when I'm depressed.

I won't go into specifics, but he is unemployed and spends majority of his time buying and reselling things online.

The problem is that he doesn't have the money in the first place to be buying these things; I just found out he has taken out 2 new credit cards this month alone just so he could charge them without going over the minimum. 

I've tried, endlessly, to talk to him and tell him this isn't normal or healthy but he considers it to be his ""occupation"" and will not listen. He is majorly in debt, and if anything happens to him (which wouldn't be surprising based on all of his health complications), my family takes on all of his debt. I'm scared.

1174;bipolarreddit;Proto_Ubermensch;23/01/2019;"Will You Take Medications For The Rest of Your Life? It’s been 2 years since I was hospitalized for a manic/psychotic episode where I was diagnosed with bipolar. Over the course of 5 months post-hospitalization I tried a myriad of medical concoctions including lithium, abilify, latuda, and many others whose name I’ve since forgotten. Whether due to the depressive episode that came directly after my manic one or the terrible side effects I decided I would go off medications.

So now it’s been 19 months since I’ve taken any medications. I’ve avoided drugs, alcohol, and other stressors. I make sure to sleep 8-10 hours a day, eat healthy, drink lots of water, workout, meditate, etc. and it seems like I’ve been stable. I still get occasional periods of depression which I easily ride out or bursts of hypomania which makes life easier however all delusions/serious effects have all but disappeared.

I recognize however that can be an illusion and at any point, things can spin outside of my control. So recently I got a pdoc to write a prescription for Latuda, however, I haven’t picked up the medication yet because I’m starting to question whether I should get back on it.

This is primarily because I feel like the effects of long-term medication use can have irreversible consequences on the brain. It doesn’t help that we have had 0 longitudinal studies showing the effects of staying on these medications for 20+ years (if there are, I'd love to see them!). So given that I’m currently stable, I am having a hard time convincing myself to start taking medications indefinitely. I understand some people cannot function without their medication, however, I’m lucky to not be part of that cohort (for now).

Anyways I’m not advocating that anyone stop taking medications but I am curious how others view this topic, do you intend on sticking with medications for the rest of your life?";1527;77;244;52;20;511;203;341
1175;bipolarreddit;PryceTheHippo;03/01/2019;"I’m becoming hopeless Everytime my pdoc prescribes me a new med I immediately get online to see what side effects are the most common for a lot of people, if they liked it, how long it took to work, etc. I know it’s anecdotal information but it eases my anxiety about new meds.

And everytime I look there are people who say it doesn’t work, it made things worse, but then there are also a lot of people that say it’s their miracle drug and it gave them their life back. 

I know everyone is different and it takes time to find the right combo of meds but I’m so tired of getting my hopes up thinking “maybe this time this one will work” and so far it never has. 

People sing praises for Lamictal from the mountain tops and I’ve been on it for months and the only effect it’s had is making me stupid. Rexulti made my existing sleep problems worse and unbearable hand tremors. SSRI’s didn’t work for obvious reasons. Latuda made me hypomanic. 

I’ve been on 450mg of Wellbutrin daily for three years and it doesn’t even keep me afloat anymore. I want to die every day and everything makes me cry. 

So now I’m on Lamictal, Wellbutrin, and I’m starting lithium but I don’t want to take it in the first place because I doubt it’ll work and it’s incredibly high maintenance compared to every other option It seems. 

But I’m taking it. Because I have to. And it’s not going to work again just like nothing else has. I’m going to be anxious and suicidal until I die which might be sooner rather than later if I can never find any reprieve from this awful disease

I recently started dating someone who was diagnosed BP I and is medicated. I'm new to this sub, so instead of asking something that has already been asked, I searched through some of the older posts about BP and romantic relationships.

I have been around bipolar most of my existence--one of my very best friends has been in my life for 25 years and is BP II. I recognize the difference between the two, that BP affects different people differently, and that all relationships have some common facets regardless of their nature.

But I am curious. Is there anything you wish you would have known going into a friendship or romantic relationship? Anything you wish your friend or partner would have known?

After a very shitty year where I lost our house to foreclosure, our savings, and nearly did in my loving family (wife and two daughters, 13 and 10), I’ve  been diagnosed as bipolar. 

The psychiatrist has me on a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant for now, which seem to be helping. They’re still making a full assessment so we’ve got a ways to go as yet. 

My wife has been amazing — despite the shock of the foreclosure and all the monetary problems she’s stayed with me and helped me find well recommended doctors and therapists for help. 

We’ve been going through couples counseling as well to help us get on the same page — the couples counselor suggested I might be bipolar, which started us working through the diagnosis process and into treatment. 

My kids haven’t been told of the diagnosis yet, and we’re not sure if or when we will tell them, or how. 

Personally, I’m a little freaked out. I’ve already been diagnosed as ADD, which seems to also be correct, but that seems a lesser issue since I am able to hyper focus and accomplish a lot. Or maybe that was a combination of hyper focus and manic episodes. 

I’m having trouble coming to terms with who’s right now. It’s been a hard blow, and has fractured my self image. I’ve always considered myself in control of my mind and actions and now I really don’t know what I’m in control of any more. It’s been surreal and I’ve been feeling a little lost. 

I don’t have any specific questions at this time; I partly wrote this to just make the diagnosis more real.  

Any comments anyone can provide are welcome. I’ve got so much to learn. ";1285;55;237;24;20;424;177;314

My anxiety began to grow to the point where i felt like the ground was shaking below me all the time and the walls were creaking. I got an intense ptsd flashback where I acted out. There were some nights were i was SURE that all the cameras were watching me and people in photos or paintings were spying on me. This would be around the time work would get complicated and I would need to leave, but for the first time ever, I pushed myself through it and made it! My raise was 50¢ but it really does add up to a lot. I also got a store key, so I can close on my own now! (This is probably not a big deal but this is the first time ever for me)

I’ve been working there for about 2 months now. It doesn’t seem like much, but this is the longest time I’ve kept a job in a while.

I'm on a medicine regimen that is working really well for my mood, however my body has adjusted to it and my memory attention and focus are still no where near where they were pre-treatment. Which I'm a biochem student and I have finals in less than two months so this isn't ideal. 


Currently im on 100mg seroquel (I don't think this is effecting my memory very much, it's the first thing the started me on, tbh if it is this id rather have the sleep)

And 100mg lamictal (I'm pretty sure this is the culprit, but idk if stopping it and trying to find something else while school is on session would be safer or riskier in terms of cognative abilities)

They had me on buspar but i stopped taking that within a few weeks of school starting because it was just impossible. And stopping that helped a lot and then he raised my lamictal and it's still better than it was but not where it needs to be.
I'd really rather not take amphetamines, but if anyone has had similar problems with these or could suggest something that's helped them so I could do some research and bring it up with my doc in a few weeks thatd be wonderful.

I went to the emergency room this morning for chest pain, feeling faint and uncontrollable shaking. I've been experiencing chest pains and shortness of breath, headaches, bouts of weakness and an inability to control my body temperature recently and it was so intense this morning I felt it warranted getting check out. This was the sickest I had ever felt in my life. 

After getting to a room the Dr came in, quickly looked at my info and asked about the lamictal and when I last had my levels checked. She said they'd do a blood test to check and left. Someone came to draw my blood and did an ekg. A while later the nurse came back to let me know I'd been discharged. I wasn't checked out by the Dr, when the heart rate and bp would go crazy no one came to check, my resting heart rate would jump up to ~150bpm, my blood pressure would shoot up too. I had to ask about the test results as I recieved the discharge papers as no one came back to let me know. They just checked my lamictal levels and said I was good to go. I was embarrassed when I left as I was still feeling sick and people in the waiting room watched me warble out and were asking if I was ok. 

Is this a thing that happens? A Dr sees the bp diagnosis and medication and decides whatever's going on is simply a medication or bp issue?

I have also been in impatient once and am currently treated for my mental illness through therapy and medication (lithium and streamline).

After feeling good and manageable for a decent amount of time, I entered into a relationship and have been with him now for 6 months. It's hard.

I don't know how to explain this... But my reality and perception is constantly compromised by my mental state. Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming... And when I snap out of it or come back from it... It feels like it never happened, but still leaving those I love confused and hurt.

I get scared of myself and sometimes don't recognize myself and just seeing a glimpse of myself in the mirror is scary. I feel like a whole other person.

My anxiety that the ups and downs brings leads me to want to make impulsive decisions such as cutting out those I love, including my boyfriend. Feeling cozy and settled with him or anyone scares me and even happy moments send me fear that makes me want to run. But I don't really want to leave. I just don't what to do?

I feel torn between wanting to take care of it myself or want a lot of love and comfort. Just another human in the room reassuring me that everything is under control makes me feel grounded and overrides my emotional illusions.

One misconceptions leaves me simmering in sorrow for days and days and even up to a month. One sentence feels like it could make or break me. And one reactions feels like it can end my life if it comes from someone close to me... Ecspecially if it involves a negative, failing perception I have about myself.

I feel like I can't do it. Between the sorrow, constant confusion, frustration, and pure exhaustation my brain imposes on me... I want to die a lot. And think about it regularly then feel guilty and resentful about how it would hurt those I care about. I wish I got murdered quite frankly. I can't control that, but it would be nice. That's just bluntly how I feel and what I want since no one here knows my real identity.

I try to pretend I have no issues by being fully invested and loved at work. I feel like I have to earn acceptance in my work life but also my personal life because of the burden my mental illness places on others for even knowing me.

I love being productive, getting things done, and I'm very goal orientated... And I get so fucking pissed and feel like a failure to everyone but especially myself when my mental illness damages days, weeks, and even months worth of plans or goals.

There's so much more I can say. But I really just want to know or hear from people that get it, that understand, that know what I'm talking about. I want to how you deal with. I feel like I'm literally crazy at times.

Thank you.";2264;95;416;48;46;735;257;545

This is all coming off the back of a month long depressive episode with a lot of suicidal contemplation, which was finally ended by an increase in seroquel to 300mg, an increase in lamictal to 100mg twice a day, and a decrease in lithium over the last few months from 900mg a day to 300. 

I have felt fantastic the last 4 or so days, but everyone around me is freaking out because I'm too hyper and loud and all over the place, especially  my gf, who's going through a rough patch. I can't even sit still long enough to comfort her and it's really freaking her out. Of course the only other time I've been like this was right before I crashed and burned and went to the hospital for a week, so bad feelings all around I guess. 

It just seems odd that this would come about after an increase in seroquel and lamictal. If it stays too much longer I might drop a note for the psychiatrist, because I know this isn't sustainable, it just feels so damn good.

Is this common to switch like this after a med change? Also, how the hell do I deal with all the people freaking out thinking this is going to wind up putting me in the psych ward again?

I'm very new here so please forgive me if this has already been discussed...

I was recently diagnosed and prescribed Lamictal (this happened two days ago). I've been seeing a counselor for some other issues and she recommended going to psychiatrist.

My therapist/psychiatrist recommend keeping track of my moods. This seems so easy...So I write down how I'm feeling or rate how I'm feeling. I've been trying to do this for the past month. I have found it so hard to identify my emotions/moods/feelings.

I sit down and either use an app (Dayio, Evernote...) or a physical notebook to start my journaling. I get in my own head so much that I can't seem to figure out how I am feeling. Lately, it feels like I am making it all up. I overthink it all so much that I think ""Oh nevermind...I'm fine"" and just move on with my day. I guess my question is...how do others track their moods/feelings?

A common pattern - I will go into therapy of some kind, talk about how I'm depressed, I'm sad all the time, feel like nothing ever helps me, meds never work, I want to kill myself and the only thing stopping me is fear it won't work. Get frustrated at all their suggestions, walk out feeling worse than I did going in. Then my meds will get adjusted or I'll cycle back up again and feel absolutely fine, and quit therapy until the next crisis. Because of this, I'm sure my chart is covered with notes about how I'm a difficult patient, irrational, dramatic, draining, argumentative and I have have clinicians suggest I have borderline pd or at least traits of it. The thing is when I'm euthymic I'm not like this at all. I may be a little more sensitive than the average person but other than that I'm perfectly normal. 

Anyway, my point is that I always get embarrassed by how melodramatic I get during depressive episodes and because of this I am scared to go back to therapy and repeat this pattern. I already have a lot of difficulty opening up to people and have always found therapy insanely difficult, and this just makes it worse.

We were very close and I hadn't seen her in about a year since I live on the other side of the country. I ended up not going to the funeral but shared some memories that my family read. I won't get into details here but we may also sell one of her properties that was very meaningful to me growing up. Her passing also caused some tension in our family, which I'm not personally involved in but still feels stressful.

They feel like it's the best thing ever. But then I suddenly lose interest. It happens on small and large scale. Small obsessions go from being completely obsessed with one music artist or style of music for maybe a month or less to a point where I can't think of anything else. I play the same stuff over and over and over again and eventually lose interest and move on. This happens to a lot of people but it spreads to other things. A lot of my hobbies are like this. Sculpture, painting, working out, video games, there's do many. On a larger scale: When I was in college I switched my major 4 times because I would get completely obsessed and passionate with the major then suddenly I would lose so much interest that it became hard to go to class, focus, do homework etc so I would eventually switch majors. My last major I decided to stick with because I couldn't afford to change any more so I just dealt with it and did the minimum to get my degree. This happens with jobs too. I'll really truly love a job, work there for 6 months and then start dreading it every day.

1234;bipolarreddit;retroprim;21/02/2019;"Lithium and the horrible acne So I just got Reddit to post this, honestly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started taking lithium carbonate for bipolar disorder in September 18. My dose was increased in December 18, and about a week later I started having terrible acne appear. I know this is a side effect of the medication. I've read all there is that I can find about lithium acne and that it supposedly is harder to treat than regular acne, and in some cases makes peoples acne worse in the long term (they never had problems with acne, suddenly it's coming back months later after clearing up, etc). I've been off lithium for about a month and a week or so now, and nothing's changed in regards to my oh-so-lovely breakout.

&amp;#x200B;

I started birth control (? I honestly have no clue if this will work, I used to take birth control for my acne when I was younger), I'm now using tazorac prescribed to me by my PCP, and I'm going to see a dermatologist soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I fall asleep eventually, but wake up 3-4 hours later feeling wide awake like someone gave me a shot of epinephrine. Minus feeling on edge, my mood is more or less fine (not up or down too much). Despite not really sleeping much (I usually need 8 hours to feel human in the morning), I am awake and fully functional during the day. Should I be worried that this is the start of a manic (or more likely hypomanic) episode, or is this likely just me adjusting to my new medication?

The study, which analysed data from 522 trials involving 116,477 people, found 21 common anti-depressants were all more effective at reducing symptoms of acute depression than dummy pills.

But it also showed big differences in how effective each drug is.""

Major takeaways: 

EDIT: Anti depressants do work better than placebos for most people but their effectiveness varies.

More people could be helped by anti-depressants.

Anti depressants don't work for everyone.

I truly believe I am the most horrendous creature on this earth. I wouldn't even call myself human because I'm so monstrous I feel I don't resemble one. It should be considered a crime for me to expose my appearance to other people. No one deserves to look at such a disgusting thing. I don't deserve to be alive.

Those thoughts are always in the back of my head. Sometimes I'll look at myself and feel confused because I don't understand how I could feel like that. I look normal. Even pretty sometimes. And other times I'll look at myself and cry and scream and vomit because of how hideous I am. I don't understand why I have to hate myself so much. 

How can my feelings change so much? How can I be okay with who I am one moment and want to die because of how I look the next? I can't even trust my eyes to know how I look. I don't know if I'm pretty and I don't know if I'm hideous. And I can't ask anyone because I know every answer other than ""you're disgusting"" will make me think they're lying to make me feel better.

When I see someone look at me, I know they're thinking of me. Thinking how can a human look this grotesque. Despising me. Hating me because my existence forced them to look at me. I don't ever want to go outside because I know I'm being looked at and being watched and being hated.

I'm so tired. I've been in therapy since I was 6 because of things like this. 13 years of therapy hasn't helped one bit. In fact, I hate myself even more. Because wouldn't constant lessons change my mind a bit if I was actually wrong? So I must be right. I haven't been to a doctor since October but I have made an appointment for next month. I don't know if I can last that long.

I have been struggling, recently I have found out I am pre-diabetic, and that my years of self medication mixed with regular meds has done a number on my liver.   This has caused me to go on a diet, and change my regular intake of food, essentially being 275lbs at 5'8"" is not a great thing.  I've been agitated by just about everything, couple that with a mixed state and it's a powder keg waiting to explode in rage.

I could tell that this was going to be something they were planning on doing for the entirety of the session, so I decided to try and nip it in the bud, what started off as a joke turned into a full on rage rant. No profanity or throwing specific individuals under the bus, more so a blanket warning that I will not be taking shit from anyone.

1250;bipolarreddit;robbyes;02/04/2019;"My experience with tramadol This past week I was prescribed 8 tablets of tramadol for an unrelated post-treatment painkiller, and I felt completely different. 
It’s hard to explain, but basically even during arguments and other stressful situations that unsettle me, I was able to stay calm and focused. I felt enough of the “anger” emotion that I knew I was angry, but my brain was calm enough to accept the anger and be passive while yet acknowledging it. I was also productive and in great spirits, which seems to be the norm on this opioid.

I’ve never been diagnosed and I’ve always lied on depression quizzes at the hospital, but the truth is a couple weeks ago it hit me that my mood swings and depression might not be normal.

I realized that sometimes I am completely happy and good, to the point of being TOO happy. I will often hyper-organize my house, deep clean or workout every single day... basically checked off every symptom of a mania. During these times I paint,write, exercise, I eat and cook , hell I even tackle projects outside and have a hard time falling asleep for being too excited with my projects.  I’ve also had bad instances with alcohol during these times, from a feeling of cockiness and recklessness where I have acted out in ways I am ashamed of.

As for the depression, it comes on as low and long as it can be. I sleep on the couch during the day, lose weight, and am constantly weepy or angry. I do not like to work on anything, much less have the energy to deep clean or create. 
These “mood swings” as Ive always called them come in bouts of weeks, sometimes months and occasionally like I mentioned as a result of an argument or something else incredibly stupid. 

This is having a toll on my marriage and family, and I am curious as to medications having any similar effect on me as tramadol , which I read up on and completely agreed with the following: 

“In fact, one of the reason people like taking Tramadol is because for some people it works as an antidepressant, producing euphoria or energy, unlike other opioids which tend to make people drowsy. This has led it being used recreationally, while people still go to work or live their daily lives.” blog.iodine.com

I am obviously not going to get this prescription refilled and don’t need the cautions because like I said, I read up and completely understand the danger of taking opioids as anything other than a TEMPORARY strong painkiller.

TL;DR I’m (24f) hesitant to take the first step in getting diagnosed or treated for what I suspect is Bipolar 1 Disorder. Had a good experience with an unrelated painkiller and would like to hear from people who self-diagnosed and are now on treatments, or anyone who can relate to my experience.

To preface, I'm 21, got diagnosed with BP1 in November of 2017, have been medicated since February 2018, and started going to a talk therapist last June. 
Despite having experienced detrimental manic episodes within the past year (severing relationships, abruptly quitting a job I needed, etc) I can't help but think that I don't *actually* have bipolar. 
It's probably because the meds are working and helping, but regardless of that fact I can't shake it and start to convince myself that I don't really need them. 
In therapy I've learned a bunch about my habits and childhood issues, but we don't really discuss things through the lens of having bipolar specifically.

Since then I’ve experience a mixed episode,during which I displayed psychotic symptoms and have been pretty stable for about two weeks. Last week I became really paranoid for a few days. I feel very suspicious of my parents, who I live with, and kept thinking they had been altered and weren’t their original selves. I also had several auditory hallucinations for just one day. This whole this is extremely worrying as I have been violent when psychotic before (if I feel my life’s in danger, I’ll fight and have assaulted staff). 

I have a great MH team but I’m hiding things from them, I don’t want to tell them about potential psychotic stuff because I can’t face it, I can’t face them suggesting I’m Schizoaffective or prone to psychosis or this is going to happen again.

I have a stable job, I'm in college,  I have a girlfriend who lives with me, and I'm sober for the most part  (no more hard drugs). I just feel so lost to the wind. I feel like I've let control go to life. Like I'm a plastic sack blowing around aimlessly. I feel like the things around me control my life more than I do.

I know this is gonna just get buried in this sub but I needed to vent. I feel like I do everything the way I'm supposed to do but it just isn't enough. The best thing I've ever done or most perfect isn't good enough. Not for me or anyone else. I can't afford therapy plus I live in eastern Texas so therapy isn't very extensive in my area.

I want to quit but I know I'm way to strong of a human being to do that. I only want to feel like I'm on the right track. I want to feel like I'm doing the right thing. I feel like I am sad but I can't exhibit the emotion. I just feel frustrated, anxious, and blank. I don't know what I want from posting this other than some else to try to understand because everyone else around me seems to not have a grasp on what I feel or I'm going through. 

I love you all that are going through anything difficult right now. Please know that you aren't alone. I suffer just like you. I'd love to talk to you if you'd like to talk. Just never give up because you aren't the only one. This sub has taught me I'm not alone. Thank you if you've made it this far. I just want to feel connected.";1490;42;364;18;41;502;178;424

I was seeing a therapist but stopped going when after I was leveled for a while. I’m on medication as well. Although I’m on medication I went through a manic phase of high energy through the month of December. I didn’t really notice. I’m bad at spotting my moods.

1271;bipolarreddit;russkispaceship;03/03/2019;"DEPRESSION HAS A PURPOSE: HOW TO USE IT RIGHT This text discusses personal experiences with depression and suicidal tendencies.
It is an amended and an updated version. I edited it for mistakes and added a couple of paragraphs alongside with real-life illustrations. If you have already read the first version, just look for the new paragraphs. Thank you for reading.

I think I know now why I need depressive phases.
By saying that, I don't mean the physical side of depression. This implies fatigue, general exhaustion, increased or decreased need for sleep, the same applies to appetite, drop in libido, decrease in hygiene and general activities. The body needs to recover. It takes time.
What I am talking about is the emotional, intellectual, — if you want — spiritual side of depression. I think I found a purpose of depression on the other side of the coin.
It appears that I grow during these times, because I reflect a lot on the recent events, critically evaluate my actions and decisions, as well as my reasoning behind them. Most importantly, I try to understand my mistakes and to learn lessons from them so that I will never repeat them again.
In all fairness, it is a painful and self-destructive process. Most of the time, it is counterproductive and worsens the state of an affected person with ever increasing speed. It is a vicious circle of being paralyzed, feeling ashamed of it and guilty for own disengagement, inability to find enough energy to at least do things that you generally like (normally, it’s worse: you completely lost interest in the things you like), being paralyzed from shame and guilt, hating yourself for this lameness, becoming ever more disgusted by your own bad smell and a total disaster on the floor and in the kitchen, feeling dizzy and weak at all times, having a hurting back and ass cheeks from spending days in bed, losing all respect for yourself and hope for improvement, wanting to give up and to end the pain.
You are a burden. You are a disgrace. You are worthless. You have no purpose. Your existence does not make any sense. You are a waste of resources. You are a disappointment. Your parents must be ashamed of you. They should regret bringing you to the world. You will never produce anything meaningful. You will never change anything. You mean nothing. You are a lab rat in the obstacle race in an endless labyrinth. You were born a slave to the indifferent capitalist feudalistic world system. You will never find your place in the society. All spots are occupied. Even the untouchable ones. But you are nothing special. You don’t even have the guts to slip down the social ladder and join the untouchables in protest against the system. “Fuck the system” remains just a graffiti on the platform of a subway station. You are a fucking joke.
This is an approximation of the thinking patterns typical of a depressive episode. They dance in circles in your head, every day. They hold hands and take turns in solo parts. They exhaust you. You wake up with them and you go to sleep with them. You cry when you fall asleep. You cry when you wake up. Day after day.
Slowly you develop a real anxiety for answering phone calls. They terrify you. People want something from you. We don’t want that. Opening the mail box becomes a real nightmare. You spend days pursuaiding yourself to open your mail account or to open your post box. You stop answering text messages. You are tired of lying that you are doing fine. You are not fine.
During the depression, I take a pause of silence. I cut my connections to the outer world and go inside myself. I need that time free of background noises and external advice to keep hearing my thoughts. This is the time when I re-evaluate my knowledge and values. Regarding this, three semi-cool metaphors come to my mind.

Winter tree

Depression looks like a tree in a night of winter sleep. That very deep and dreamless slumber. Though, how would we know? They might as well watch nightmares, which could compete with the Saw, or I spit on your grave. It is sad and does not bring joy to anyone. To some, it might even look ugly. Sometimes, decomposing fall foliage that cover the decaying human and animal feces with a soft fluffy coat smell bad. I mean, really bad. You better keep on moving.
The tree stops interacting with the surrounding life. Birds abandoned their nests and no longer sing on its branches. It lost all its leaves and stays alone for the rest of the winter. It might appear that it is cold or dead. It is winter that makes its skin harden and darken. It becomes raw and thick.
Or we could look at it differently. Winter can be beautiful. I love winter. It is my favorite season. In Germany, winter is usually gray and wet. The wind is brutal, you don’t want to go outside. The gray sky weighs heavy on your head. You are cold.
On those days, I often must think of winter in Russia. With a nostalgic smile and a sharp wrench in my heart, I see my way home, my parents’ house, a rare artifact of Russian wooden architecture that survived the Revolution of 1917, on a peaceful winter night. The sky was beautifully painted in the darkest and deepest blue. Twinkling stars were magically winking at me. The way home from the bus stop was a thin stamp white trail in the snow. It lied between two snowbanks, as high as your knees. Tiny snow flakies sparkled in the soft orange light of the lanterns along the road. Like in a slow motion, the snow was falling on my palms and in my mouth in huge fluffy flakies. It was Christmas magic. No vehicles were driving by. It was so silent, that the only sound that sent waves into the space was crispy and squeaky snow under my heavy winter boots. I was the happiest I could be. 
Inevitably, the spring comes. And the tree that was asleep just yesterday, wakes up and gets more beautiful than ever. It gives birth to fresh crispy-green leaves, it grows more branches which are strong and flexible. The new ones make the tree bigger and older.
It hosts more nests and attracts more birds to sing on its branches in the early morning when the sun rises. It amazes more people, they enjoy being around the tree. People go outside and spend time in its shadow. They arrange pick-nicks under its thick coat of leaves, laugh, eat and take pictures. More animals and kids play on the tree’s branches. Some might even build a small cabin on them, which will become a young kid’s secret escape into the magical world of their dreams.
In Russia, they have a tradition of hugging a tree. It is believed that the tree would suck up all of the negativity and charge you with positive energy. Many people even have their special tree, which suits their personality. Some prefer the pine tree, others the oak tree. Lime trees and birches are popular as well.
Then the fall approaches. The facade starts cracking, the leaves are falling off. Everything is getting browner and rainier. Slowly, everyone left the tree behind. Birds headed off south to have a sex-vacation, people are running from box to box hiding under an umbrella. It's winter again.

Current view from from kitchen
Last spring, I had a crazy idea that I can be an artist. So in a creative madness I decorated the only tree in our backyard with pieces of my old linen. And then died it with acrylic paint. I conceptualized it as a memory tree. Because my linen kept memories of nearly everything and outlived a lot of relationships and tragedies. Now, my roommate says, it is the only thing that reminds him of joy in the whole backyard.

Computer game

Depression is like a progressing computer game. You need to die so many times until you learn the lesson and get to the next level.
Sometimes, when the level is hard, it gets frustrating and exhausting at some point. You lose interest and give up on the game. And when you do that, you stop playing the game and stop unlocking the next levels. That's a metaphor of the suicide.
Suicide is the worst possible side-effect of mental illnesses. It should rightfully be taken seriously.

Real suicide

Last summer, a fellow member from the self-help group, which I regularly visit, jumped off a roof. She left two kids behind. She was young and had a special outlook on the world, which she lived in photography. She had been deeply depressed since March, when I saw her for the first time, which was the first time I visited a group meeting.
In the flash round, she cried. She said, she could not bear it anymore, that she just wanted to give up. I felt that. I felt her pain. I knew too well those two sentences. There comes a time when only those two are left. And you just cry and say them over and over again. I wanted to give her a warm hug and to let her cry on my shoulder. But we didn't know each other. So, I had to restrain.
At the end of May, she committed suicide. It shook deeply the whole group. It became so apparent that this is how the game ends for us. Many of us were deeply grieving.
Up to 17% of people with bipolar disorder will take their lives as a result of their illness, making it the #1 cause of premature death in people with this disorder. Women attempt suicide about 3 times more often than men, although men are 4 times as likely to complete suicide. People with bipolar disorder are 2x more likely to attempt suicide than someone with a unipolar disorder. In a review of deaths of individuals with bipolar disorder from 1936-1988, 19% of 9,389 deaths were found to be because of suicide.

At her funeral on July 3rd, I was brokenhearted. I was late because it had taken me quite a time to choose the right black shirt and trousers. Dresses seemed too festive to me. I was nervous, it was my first funeral in Germany. It was my first suicide funeral. It was my first mental health funeral.
The chapel was crowded. I stood leaning on the cold wooden door. I breathed heavily and needed time to process. I had never seen so many people attending a funeral. Those are small and private in Russia unless you are some kind of famous or rich. I counted some 250 people. All grieving. Some crying.
Speeches were boring and long. Also, swampy and sticky. I was outraged when the priest said, ""We cannot know why [she] left. It will remain a mystery forever."" I wanted to scream. I wanted to scream so loud so that he would stop talking. How dare you say that we don't know why she jumped off the roof? How dare you indifferently pass the verdict that it will remain a mystery? I wanted to scream. Or to leave the chapel and slam the door.
But I couldn't leave. I needed to stay. I owed it to her. I started crying. I couldn't stop. Tears ran in deep rivers down my cheeks. I didn't have a napkin. I couldn't bear the ceremony, but I couldn't go either.
In the chapel across the columns, her family hung out on a string her photographs for the visitors to take away as a memory of her. I waited for most people to take one and leave the chapel. By the time I came up to the string with hanging photographs, I only had three left to choose from. I picked a very bleak image of a closed backyard, probably taken from a balcony on some fourth floor, on a clouded winter day. It was bleak. Like depression that kills us. I took it to remember this.
The weather outside was good and sunny. It seemed totally out of place in the given context. The sun brutally burned my shoulders in the black shirt. I hate the sun. I hate everything when there is the sun. It blinds me, makes me sweaty and hot, and gives me headaches. Also, it burns my skin. So, no reason to love it. As I stood in line to throw my flower into the grave, I spent my time hating the sun. In that moment, I didn't realize how much this day would impact me. Her name was Verena.

Depression

Directly after the funeral, I fell into the deepest, darkest and the coldest well of depression. None of the previous episodes could come close to this one in severity. I was tired, I was failing on all fronts. I had ten days left to write my master's thesis, after which I had to go to Russia for three weeks — I deserved a vacation. I had been in a manic phase when I invited my then-partner's mom to come to visit Russia with me. Also, I didn't know how I was going to pay my bills. Verena's death was the trigger.
When it became clear that I would not be able to finish my thesis before the deadline and that I needed an extension, it was too late to cancel the trip. Christoph's (my ex) mom had already made all the reservations. I didn't want to go there. I had a bad feeling. I wanted to stay home and close off myself from the angry, cruel world. But I rarely change plans. So, I went.
I arrived in Moscow already at my worst. The first thing that I did upon arrival was buying a battery of alcoholic beverages and red bull cans to keep me going. This way I was going to write my thesis and to finish it by August 3rd. Good plan, destined for success.
I worked, but much more I drank, smoked and had severe headaches. A bad state to write your thesis. My next step was to keep myself awake by the cocktail vodka red bull, with a lot of vodka and a lot of red bull. Three all-nighters, four cigarette packs. I came forward. But the body never forgives.
Then Christoph's mother came. For a whole week, I needed to guide, to entertain and to translate for her. She was nearly helpless without me. She didn't know the language, people often didn't speak English and she wasn't very well at that either. Most importantly, she couldn't plan her program by herself. And she needed company by nearly any activity she undertook. A rich touristic program requires to get up early and to go to bed late. I was getting exhausted. I gave out all my energy, even the emergency generator. Burned all calories. No spoons left.
I still needed to finish my thesis. So again all-nighters, again red bull. With the only difference: I increasingly preferred watching TV shows over writing the thesis. And I couldn't wake up. I turned into a horrible host and an indifferent individual. I could not wait for her to leave. A shameful thought, but I could not ban it from my thinking feed. I was anticipating my trip to Saint Petersburg, the time in a summery St. Petersburg, which everyone is talking about. I wanted to fall in love with St. Petersburg too. I was excited to see Sonya, my dear friend-by-coincidence. She is an architecture enthusiast and gives brilliant city tours.
Instead, I locked myself up in her room for the whole week of my stay. I only came out of the room to either visit the bathroom or smoke a cigarette. Much more seldom it was because of the food. I was starving. Worse, I was deadly afraid to go outside. I was afraid of people and public space. I went outside only to buy cigarettes or alcohol, only at night and only in Sonya's company.
What was I doing behind the closed doors the whole week? I was watching a TV show. Over and over again. Until I exhaust myself and pass out. Sometimes Sonya forced me to work on my thesis, and I did. But more often I watched TV series, not wrote my thesis. In this fashion, I spent my last week before the deadline.
I failed. Self-explanatory. I went to my psychiatrist and first thing cried a quarter hour. I was the worst failure in the history of failures. He gave me a sick leave until the end of October. I had time to crawl out of the deep stinky rabbit hole I had accidentally fallen into. 

_____________
So back to the pink fluffy unicorns: I, for example, like to play Two Dots. It's an endless game which gets ever more complicated. Being depressed I spent hours solving new problems and trying to unlock a new level. Eventually, I would give up and even delete the app from my phone. But then occasionally, I would install it again and start it all over. Because deleting the app did not kill the small worm who wants salvation from unresolved problems.

Lighthouse stairs

Lastly, depression is like a brief stop on the endless stairs leading to the top of a lighthouse. You take upon this torture because of the view that it rewards you with in the end. The way up there is at times unbearable and brutal to your lungs and leg muscles. The space is tight, and the air is bad.
Normally, the stairs are also crowded af, if we take a tower in a city hall or a cathedral. So, taking a short breath break is like a lottery. When you do get a chance, you would bow putting your hands on your knees. You breathe heavily and your face is red. You get no air, your lungs hurt, your leg muscles are sore. Looking either up or down makes you dizzy, and your feet sweat with tiny ice-cold drops.
In that moment you question your sanity in deciding to punish yourself with these stairs. You now see the promised view in relation to your suffering. You re-evaluate the price- performance ratio. And the results are not in favor of the view. But the stream of people on the stairs keeps moving. In most cases, it carries you away, again and again upwards.
Maybe the saddest thing about this is that in most cases you barely spend ten minutes on the roof of the tower. You briefly enjoy the view. Sometimes the view is disappointing. The weather was bad, gray clouds covered the city with a thick ceiling. The wind was strong and freezing. Your hair was flying around and got in your eyes and your mouth. It might be dirty and noisy upstairs. Even better, if you are afraid of height. In most cases, it's pretty crowdy on top. People are pushing each other, trying to get the best view. No one is talking to each other.
It is understandably very upsetting. You take pictures from all possible angles anyways and go downstairs. The way down seems much shorter than the way up. You easily run downstairs asking yourself whether the view was worth the trouble. You don't know.
Sometimes though, you might give up halfway through and turn back. Similar to the computer game wormy, we have a tower wormy. Every once in a while, it bites a little bit off your achievement organ and crawls inside your thinking organ. Then you forget about it only to remember again sometime later.

Hope

Now, going back to my introduction, when I wrote that during the depression, I try to understand my mistakes and to learn lessons from them so that I will never repeat them again.
In manic phases, which in my case normally follow depressive episodes, I challenge myself to act upon my new knowledge and imperatives. I need to do that to prove myself that I learned the lesson and deserve redemption.
I am my strongest critic. I need to forgive myself to move on, not the forgiveness of the others. I pass my own judgment on my actions. Because I know best all my motifs and thoughts. And before I ultimately forgive myself, I ask for forgiveness people that I hurt. Not formally to check the box, but genuinely and humbly.
NB! I did not intend to romanticize depression with these metaphors, or worse, to implicate that I have the cure to depression. Depression is a serious, brutal disease that tragically changes people's lives, and sometimes ends them. Therefore, I do not recommend terminating your prescription meds, if you are affected by depression or other mental health issues. I take a bunch of those on a daily basis. However, I do not propagate for taking medication either. Whatever works for you best is best for your health. Invest time into exploring those ways. It always pays off.

If you are affected by depression

If you are affected by depression, allow yourself time to recover. My former therapist used to say: ""If you want to lie on the couch, lie on the couch"". That's the best advice I can give you. When you are well, you won't lie on the couch anyways. Take your time. There is no hurry when it comes to health.
Second advice is to start slow and small. Make your bed. It's challenging enough. Don't be ashamed of feeling like taking a shower or doing laundry (because you have nothing left to wear) is Mount Everest (or Mount Weather rofl). It's okay. All people with depression share this mess and this shame. I think we should talk about this more, to support each other. So again, start small. Make your bed. It's enough.
Third thing, your depression procrastination pays off. Hundreds if not thousands of hours that I spent on YouTube watching beauty tutorials, BuzzFeed videos and in-depth analyses of each Game of Thrones’ episode, eventually make up for the wasted time. At some point, you'll be able to connect the dots and turn that Netflix binge madness into something meaningful.
Lastly, if you have suicidal thoughts, get help immediately. Tell people about this. Tell them
how you feel. Don’t be silent. They care. Get any help that’s available and acceptable to you: medical, religious, anonymous hotline, support group, parents, friends — anything will do. However, suicidal tendencies without a doubt qualify for a good reason to make an appointment with a psychiatrist. This is how I got diagnosed. I needed to get suicidal first to notice that something is not right.

If you are close to an affected person

If you are close to an affected person, give them time. Recovery is a gradual process. Be patient and supportive. They know that they have problems with hygiene, that their room looks like an aftermath of the nuclear war, that they haven't done the dishes in weeks. It's alright. If you can, help them. If you can't, leave them. Time will come when they get up and do all the dishes and laundry in one go.
Here, the spoon theory is a great illustration of this particular face of depression (shoutout to Anja Osypova). It is a metaphor that is
used to explain the reduced amount of mental and physical energy available for activities of living and productive tasks that may result from disability or chronic illness. The term spoons are a visual representation used as a unit of measure in order to quantify how much energy a person has throughout a given day. It was coined by Christine Miserandino in 2003 in her essay The Spoon Theory. According to her theory, each activity requires a given number of spoons, which will only be replaced as the person ""recharges"" through rest. A person who runs out of spoons has no choice but to rest until their spoons are replenished. However, people with chronic diseases [...] and various disabilities may have sleep difficulties. This can result in a particularly low supply of spoons. (Ctrl+C Ctrl+V from Wikipedia)
I hear people call each other tenderly spoony. I think it's cute. So, love your spoony, they can be adorable.
My former partner Christoph used to literally drag me out of bed every day when I was at my lowest. He woke me up with the best good morning YouTube playlist and started by shaking all my body parts. It was very funny and so I started my day with a smile. Then he asked me what I wanted to wear. In most cases, I said ""Dragon. I wanna be a dragon."" So, he went into my room and brought the dragon, socks, and slippers. He took one foot out of the blanket and stroke it. Then he put a sock on it. When he was done with the second foot, he would start putting the dragon on me, while I was still lying flat. Anyway, it was funny. I laughed a lot. Next, he would put me straight up and finish dressing me up as a dragon. I was ready to start a new day.
Tell them that you love them and that you believe in them. You might need to repeat it everyday. It is crucial to regularly give the person in depression encouraging affirmation and to cheer them up. On most days in depression, I cry at least once a day. I feel hopeless and worthless. I see no exit in the darkness. My partner was there to console me too. He hugged me, let me cry into his shirt and told me over and over again what I achieved and that I can do more.
Once I was about to meet an elderly friend of mine who is usually very proud of me and thinks highly of me. I grew to perceive her appreciation as high expectations. It put a lot of pressure on me. I was afraid not to meet the standards. So, this time, being deep in depression, I got so anxious so that I wanted to cancel the plans. Every time I thought about it, I started crying and couldn't calm down. I felt like a complete failure. But canceling the plans would be a typical failure too. So, I had nothing left to do but to cry.
Christoph took an A4 notebook and started going through the recent months with me. He asked me what I did in March, April, May, June, July, and August. Unexpectedly, it turned out that I had done a lot of things and worked a lot of jobs. At least on paper. So, we decided that we killed my worst enemy: I had things to tell about. My plan was to take a shower, put something semi-fancy on and just force myself outside. I would just recite from the chart Christoph and I had made earlier and that would do it. Fake it till you make it.
It wouldn't be me if I hadn't blown up my own plan. Soon enough into my report, I got annoyed by the necessity to keep up the facade. So, I told the three ladies that I felt like a piece of shit and that I had been feeling like shit for months and that I didn't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I told them about my disorder, how I got diagnosed, how long it took me to find the medication that's right for me, that I went to a self-help group and that I found friends there. I felt relieved. And the ladies were again amazed by my honesty and strength. Of course, I thought that I didn't deserve it, but it was a huge relief, nevertheless.

Epilogue

As far as Christoph is concerned, so that you don't think that I am the luckiest girl in the world — which I was — should be rightly noted that he broke up with me three weeks ago. He couldn't deal with my illness any longer. And I let him go because he deserves it. I am deeply grateful for the time he spent next to me, feeding me off the spoon and putting the dragon on me. But I cannot force this burden on anyone.

1274;bipolarreddit;rxrunning;28/02/2018;"My new psychiatrist doesn't agree with my current diagnosis Starting in 2009 (age 17), I had increasingly awful depression, reaching a peak in late 2014 (age 22), when I checked myself into hospital for 5 days outpatient then 7 days inpatient. After this, my meds were switched from Paxil and Abilify to Effexor XR. In early 2017 (age 24), after gradually increasing the Effexor, I was bumped to 225mg a day. This sent me into a hypo manic episode for a week until I dropped it back to 150mg. My body couldn't keep up with my mind, I had no filter, and I did things without thinking.

This lead to my psych to change my diagnosis from Major Depressive Disorder to Bipolar Disorder Type 2, rapid cycling, as we believed that this wouldn't have happened if I didn't have bipolar, paired with how I had described my depressive episodes as wave-like/ebbing and growing for years. I added on lithium 300mg 2xday at this time.

Now I'm in a new state and have a new psych (age 25). I went to her last week for Rx refills and because I had the worst short-term depression in years. I couldn't work or even get out of bed for 5 days.
She says the the Effexor Lithium combo seems to have helped with some issues (anxiety, bulimia, self-harm), but isn't doing enough for the depression. She upped my Lithium to 300mg 3xday and is seeing me March 13th. Her main issue is that I don't have any issues with sleep during my ""up"" periods. I sleep normally. When I'm depressed, I sleep a lot more and have trouble getting up in the morning.

What my issue is: If I don't have bipolar, what are the other possible disorders I could have? What runs similarly to bipolar but isn't? Is there such thing as cyclical depression? If I don't have bipolar, what the hell was that episode in early 2017? 
(I asked my new psych something like this when I saw her, but she didn't have an answer for me, just shrugged it off...)

**I'm not asking that you diagnose me, just what is similar to bipolar**

Went to a 10-day detox in January. I thought I could dry out and get back into the groove that was my 6 months of clean time. But instead, I relapsed a week out. Spent the most of February bunny hopping - few days drinking, few days drying out - and realized that I had to get my ass back to rehab.

So here I am; 4th rehab in 3 years. I've been to this one twice before, I guess 3 times if you count my short stint in their detox a few weeks back. Most of the time, I get sober for 6 months and relapse +/- 7 days.

1277;bipolarreddit;sabrinaiscute9;16/01/2019;"First time posting on reddit... need help/advice/inspiration for dealing with a bipolar depressive episode Hello there.

I am 23 years old and officially got diagnosed with bipolar type 1 about a year and a half ago after being hospitalized from a month-long manic episode. after that, I was on EI for 4 months and had to take a break from school. Basically, it ruined my life.

The meds helped me remain stable, with a little bit of depression here and there.. nothing major. For the past 5 weeks, I have fallen into a deep depression. I am crying on the floor, feeling physically paralyzed, can't see my friends, and having very dark thoughts. 

I saw my psychiatrist and therapist last week and we upped my meds. I am now on 200mg Lamictal, 60mg Latuda, and 100 mg Modafinil. I also started light therapy, work out 4 days a week, take vit d, iron, and omega 3s, meditate, and am starting CBT therapy next week. I feel like I'm doing all of the right things.. which is why i feel SO frustrated that nothing seems to be working. Oh, and I got my hormonal IUD taken out as my naturopath said it might be causing my mood problems.

I don't want to die. There is so much more I want to do in life. But being severely depressed is no way to live.

People with bipolar... what med combos are you on? What other therapy has worked for you? How did you get better? I need some hope in my life right now...

Thanks all in advance. It was hard for me to post this.";1124;41;221;20;24;369;177;282

Just this week I started again having thoughts of what bridge locally I wanted to jump off, if that would be effective or should I find a parking garage instead.

I'm in the IT profession and frankly a trigger lately is helping my mother especially with IT issues almost every single day, often times things I have shown her before how to resolve but then she sits there and claims I never had which further enrages me and triggers me to start rapid cycling again.

To be quite honest its fucking disturbing how my mental well being is so tied to my financial well being.

But it also gave me a recurring, disabling fever condition. I get recurring fevers once a month around 101-104 degrees, they last 2 weeks, and my only symptoms are cold sweats, chills, and really awful flu-like aches. This condition leaves me housebound half of my life because its like having the flu constantly. I have done extensive testing for this through a rheumatologist.

My periodic fever syndrome started after starting lamictal 3.5 years ago. It started exactly a month in as I titrated up the dose. I am 99.9% sure it's tied to the medication, and my rheumatologist thinks that's very likely. I've had 6 attempts of getting off lamictal, and I absolutely cant and possibly never will be able to get off of it, so I'm stuck. It helps me too much, so I end up suicidal lowering my dose. Rheumatologist started treating me for the fever syndrome anyway in case treating the inflammation would help, but I've only had a slight reduction in symptoms. Psychiatrist says there's really nothing else for me to switch to with my history of everything I've tried, and it's down to either getting off or finding a way to treat my fevers.

1286;bipolarreddit;sarijanee;31/03/2018;"Need Advice About My Mom Hello Reddit,
I'm wondering if anyone in this group may be able to shed any advice from experience about a rough journey my family and I have been going through.

My mom and I are best friends. We use to talk everyday, until she started a few new medications after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Once the medications hit her, she no longer talks to me. No longer answers her phone. She is a lifeless walking panic attack, which was never the case until medication. 

Last May, my mom went through a traumatic experience with her brother almost being killed in Jail. He truly made a miracle of a recovery, but my mom endured a lot of stress from the situation. She went to her psychiatrist who prescribed her Seroquel to help her sleep. It did not help her sleep at all. She went manic in fact. To make a long story short, by the beginning of June she had been involuntarily admitted to the local psych ward on 72 hour hold. During those 72 hours, they took her off seroquel and the anti-depressant Paxil (Paxil she had been prescribed for almost 20 years due to OCD, which had toned down immensely in the past 10 years that she had even had her dosage lowered about 6 years prior to this) and immediately put her on 3mg of Resperidone and 1800mg of Gabapentin. Everything was pretty normal for about 2 months after the new prescriptions, then BAM. She was a completely different person. Zombie-like, unable to take care of herself, a living walking panic attack. It was just awful. Her doctor then only put her on MORE anti-psychotic medications and anti-depressants as well as a benzo. Again, making a long story short.. In September I had spoken to her psychiatrist on the phone during one of her appointments who agreed with me we should taper her off of anti-psychotics. Now fast forward and she has officially been of anti-psychotics for 2 months. She is still prescribed Gabapentin, mirtazapine, and diazepam. She is still in awful shape, but has shown signs on being more cognitive in general.

I didn't speak with her for over 2 months after Christmas. She didn't want to talk to me, or anyone else at that. I saw her right before Christmas (I live in a different state) and told her I would like to be apart of one of her appointments again over the phone, and she wouldn't let me. She moved in with her boyfriend after this all started, who I feel helps her as much as he hurts her.

A few weeks ago. our family dog died. She was 14, but the way it happened was super tragic. I talked with my mom the day it happened and she cried! Which was a great sign to me because 3 months before this she told he she couldn't cry if she wanted to She just had no emotion. So I took this as a great sign! I have noticed she no longer has one worded answers, but she can actually respond to the things I'm saying with short responses. So I see very slow improvements. I feel the experience with my dog passing away has opened her up to me a little bit more. I talked with her again about a week after, and just tried to have a normal happy conversation about me coming home for a visit in a couple of weeks and she seemed to act half-way normal again. I want to keep this door open, and open her trust back up to me again so that maybe she will let me try and help her at the doctors office again one day.. How can I keep this door open? How should I approach my mom about trying to help her again at the doctors when I go home in a couple of weeks? I miss my best friend more than anything, and this has been the toughest thing I have ever had to go through. If anyone has any experience dealing with horrible reactions to medications, and overcoming this yourself or with a loved one. Any advice would be appreciated.

P.S. I probably skipped over a lot of details, so please don't hesitate to ask questions!";3032;98;571;52;52;976;312;736

Like the title says, I'm off my meds because I'm trying to get pregnant. I thought I could handle it, but I'm cycling pretty bad right now. Luckily, I'm not suicidal, but it took everything I had to get out of bed this morning. In the past two weeks I've been delusional, anxious, depressed, energetic. All over the place. I was diagnosed in 2011 and have been on meds consistantly ever since, but my meds were deemed too risky for a pregnancy. Now that I'm in this emotional state, I'm questioning my capability to be a mother in the first place. I babysat my 2 year old nephew yesterday and it took every last drop of my energy. I came home so drained I could barely move. I'm assuming it was also compounded with my current mental fluctuations. But it'll only be more of that if I do have kids. Is it possible to find a balance with kids? Will there be time for myself and time for them? Yes, I will be getting back on my meds as soon as possible after the baby comes (if the baby comes), but will it be enough? I'm not even pregnant yet and I feel it might already be too much. I'm sorry for the word vomit, I can barely think straight right now.

I just want advice from other mothers. How did you do it? How did you survive being off your meds throughout your pregnancy?

I only recently (26/F) realized I *might* have had more than just a ""good time"" or a ""sort-of-mild-hypomanic-state-but-not-really"" during last summer, while caring for my SO (33/M), who had a terrifying psychotic manic episode for the first time in our relationship.
Until now, I never once associated my... utterly *unusual* behavior back then with BP.

It began last spring, when the fog of my life-long crippling depression suddenly lifted: First, I became motivated, euphoric and optimistic;  then, I felt like a superintellectual magic sex goddess; and then finally, between summer and fall, I turned into a binge-drinking, erratic mess who would stay up 3 or 4 days straight, had spent thousands of euros on chemistry textbooks, plant oils and booze, lost many important friends during the ride and ended a relationship of 5 intense years per text, only to start dating one of her ex's friends a month after.

Could it be that it was a one-time substance-induced mania as the treatment of my severe  ADHD had begun only a year before?
Methylphenidate usually *eliminates* my restlessness, emotional instability and impulsivity and chills me the fuck down. I can easily fall asleep at night, one/two hours after taking +30mg.
I do have episodically recurring insomnia since childhood though, which occurs seemingly independently from medication.
But still...

Does it really sound like the beginning of BP to you? Does something like an one-time mania due to ADHD meds and/or excessive use of cannabis exist?

How did your first mania evolve? Please tell.";1344;59;201;40;20;440;200;290

I have been taking lexapro for three years, b/c previous therapists diagnosed anxiety disorder.

I am a mom and wife, and my family loves me. So I really hesitate to medicate. But I also wonder if I should keep taking Lexapro? My therapist said withdrawl from that is ugly, so she doesn't recommend it. But maybe it's been triggering my mania? I was also diagnosed with mixed personality disorder, mainly borderline with a heavy dose of narcissism.

**TL;DR the Peace Corps rejected me because I admitted to having bipolar, not thinking anything of it because I am high functioning and my doctor can clear me. I decided to fight this to the bitter end, since I am not my mental illness and they can't reject me based on their discriminatory and outright archaic assumptions about the condition**

I am a 23 year old college student that will graduate this spring with degrees in Biology and French. Three years back I was diagnosed BP II, and as most of you know it was a wild ride. By communicating with my psychiatrist and by making the right lifestyle choices, I have remained totally asymptomatic for more than a year.

Being young and hoping to join Doctor's Without Borders someday, I decided I would join the Peace Corps to gain the necessary public health program experience and to expand my French (I'm looking at West Africa). I spent a large amount of time working on my resume and statement, and kept in touch with my local Peace Corps recruiter. He gave me advice and assured me that I was a shoe-in for a position in Benin because of my health care experience and language experience (I work as a full-time Rec Therapist while finishing classes full time. Not easy, but incorporating the right lifestyle choices has helped my time management).

After I turned in my application, I was informed that I would have to fill out a Health History form, divulging any medical conditions that I had. Naturally I was honest - my doctor said he'd provide a letter clearing me medically, and my recruiter already said verbatim that I am ""extremely qualified""

What happened next blew me away. An automated email was sent to me after I turned in the Health History form informing me that my ""condition"" could not be supported in the country I chose. *Not one person from the organization would speak to me further about the issue*. I've been told dozens of times about how they're sorry, but they simply don't make those decisions. What's really shocked me is that *my resume and essay we're not even looked at because of admitting the condition*.

I have been hiding my mental health ever since my diagnosis. It has not affected my professional life or my work. I am high functioning, and need no more ""accommodation"" than a ""healthy"" volunteer (whatever that is). Having them reject me for checking the ""wrong"" box made me incredibly angry and hurt. But instead of accepting this, I've been fighting it for the past 2 months. I've called senators, lawyers, mental health advocacy groups, and have begun the informal resolution process with their Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. When they asked what I hoped to get out of this process, I told them that I want to be medically cleared, and that I want them to put an end to this discriminatory process. Odds are they will not give me an inch, so I am prepared to take this to District Court (there was a case in 1996 where a volunteer was rejected because she admitted to taking antidepressants. The court ruled in her favor, and this decision gives me hope).

The most exciting development will come the end of this month. Patrick J. Kennedy, nephew of John F. Kennedy (who coincidentally founded the Peace Corps) will be coming to my city to advocate for mental health rights. Patrick Kennedy was diagnosed with bipolar himself, so I'm doing everything in my power to go to the conference and talk to him, get him a letter, anything - if there's an offhand chance to get him to lobby the PC on my behalf, I need to take it.

I'm not giving up this fight until I receive my letter of acceptance, or until they tell me ""stop calling us or we will contact the police"". I will let you guys know the newest updates as they come up - if you have any ideas for me on how to fight this archaic government process, please throw your ideas here.

As always, never give up trying new things to get your condition under control. It is possible, and things will get better if you try.";3324;151;564;83;46;1077;355;760

So today I went and saw a new doctor, because I felt my last one wasn’t listening to what I was saying, and I left there feeling worse than when when I went in. I told her as much of my history as I could remember. Answered honestly all the questionnaires she handed me, told her about my trip to the hospital, even my recreational drug use. 

At the end she pretty much told me she didn’t believe me. She asked that when I see her again to bring in a family member so she can verify my behavior in the past. I wouldn’t mind that IF 1) I hadn’t been on different medications for over 6 years 2) if I hadn’t been diagnosed for over 4 years by 2 different doctors. She then took my regular prescription and said to take 1/3 of what I was taking, and no mood stabilizer. 

I can see if she was suspicious if I came in looking for harder medication, but she doesn’t even prescribe any of that! I don’t understand why she would completely invalidate my past history. I’m sorry this is so long I’m just in complete disbelief. ";865;32;177;26;14;298;123;222

The confusion and anxiety were so palpable, and as I kept waking up and falling back asleep I felt the hallucinations weren't always limited to the sleep.  However, today I'm fine.

1315;bipolarreddit;Serendipity10;01/01/2019;"Bipolar and different perspectives? Hi everyone. I’ve been a lurker for a long time. I’ve tried to read through the subreddit and the internet to find other stories that relate to me, but I can’t seem to find it. So here it goes!

Background: I’m a 20 year old male college student diagnosed with MDD in Feb 2017, which transformed to a Bipolar2 diagnosis in Nov 2017. I’ve been on Lithium and Wellbutrin, adjusting dosages according to my psychiatrist. However things got rough ever since October since my insurance ran out so I haven’t been taking a steady dose of Lithium since (dw my insurance is now reinstated and I can’t wait to be stable wooo!)

Sorry had to get that aside. So sometimes when I notice myself being either depressed, hypomania, or in a mixed state, I can’t help but doubt my perspective on life. Sometimes my views on religion, family, self-worth, body positivity, and other thoughts change so frequently that I can’t tell if it’s my bipolar influencing my thoughts or if I’m experiencing life changes.

I’ve been doubting and question my religion (islam btw), sometimes feeling so distant. And then all of a sudden, I’ll enjoy praying and I feel so connected to God. Imagine a twist on a perspective like this but also to weed, alcohol, body image, etc. That’s been happening quite a bit.

A question for you all: have you guys ever questioned your perspective on life and doubt it being an effect of Bipolar? Sometimes I don’t know if this is who I am NOW, or if it’ll change in a few days/weeks. It really makes it hard for me to be grounded in my beliefs and have a steady outlook on life. I always think my values on life are changing because I’m growing as an individual, but what if it’s Bipolar? I would really appreciate it if I could hear any similar stories, updates, or comments where anyone could relate to this feeling. Sometimes I feel so lost because I’m sick of analyzing my thoughts and feelings 24/7 and comparing it to my previous feelings “x days or weeks ago”, and finally trying to see where and who I am today.

TL;DR — Bipolar 2, 20 year old college guy trying to figure out if these different perspectives on life I’m having are due to bipolar or are natural? How do you distinguish what’s grounded and what’s bound to change?";1808;89;316;42;29;603;210;432

1317;bipolarreddit;serrj_ua;05/04/2018;"Paxil withdrawal induced hypomania/rapid cycle I f**ed up my life in just 2 weeks.

My brief history:

* fall 2014 was prescribed Paxil 20mg/day for mild depression, anxiety and hypochondria. 
* Tapered from 20mg to 10mg in 6 month.
* I was on 10mg since June 2015 till August 2017. So: 2 years, 10mg daily. I always took medicine before go sleep.
* I tapered from 10mg/day to 2.5mg/day in 5-7 months (August 2017 ~ March 2018)
* I stopped to take medication 2 weeks ago (20 of March).

Until this point I was TOTALLY FINE. 

Now detailed description of last 2 weeks:

* First 5 days were totally fine
* On day 6 (30 MArch) first withdrawals symptoms kicked in: shivering, cold, severe insomnia
* On day 12 (1 April) withdrawals was unbearable, experience first manic/depressive episode. Decided to reinstate on 5mg(and later 10mg)/day. I took my first half pill midday.
* Day 13 (2 April): 5mg morning, 5mg evening
* Day 14 (3 April): 5mg morning, 0mg evening
* Day 15 (4 April): 5mg morning, 5mg evening
* Day 16 (today, 5 April): 5 mg morning

The symptoms I have now are rather painful and hardly bearable. Most prominent are: RAPID cycling from depressive episodes(+moredate agitation and anxiety) to hypomanic episodes and severe insomnia. Cycles changing every few hours and quite intensive! I never had this before, never!! Now I'm totally off, confused, suicidal, haven't slept cople nights. I'm in  hypomanic episode right now so I can write this post. I took sick leave at my work, but if this will continue I will lose my job completely. I beg you for advice on how I can stabilize now, based on what I've already done. I'm not even looking to weaning off meds now, as there are a lot of life circumstances now that I responsible for. I just want to stabilize and reduce pain.
What I can do at this point? It's do hard to believe I broke my brain beyond repair so rapidly, just in 2 weeks. I was normal, happy and fully of life. Now I'm anxious, agitated and depress vegetable, lying on the coach wanting to die/suicide.
Any advice highly appreciated.

P.S. yes, I visited my GP,  he put me on a waiting list to mental illness clinic (waiting time ~4 weeks) and advised to continue Paroxetine 10mg/day for 2 weeks and then increase to 20mg/day if needed. But I'm scared to follow this advice";1783;82;318;38;47;582;229;426

Told me to never contact her again. Now I feel like I'm in hell. I have a family. I have a handful of friends. But I can't build a real, trusting relationship with them. I’ve tried so hard. I have some really bad trust and attachment issues because of my dad leaving when I was 5. And then when I was 12, my mom also left(but thankfully my dad took me in and raised me from then on). This has left me in a way that I can only do one of two things. Either not get attached at all, or get extremely attached. But because of the extreme attachment leading to hurt in previous relationships, I had purposefully put space between me and others.


She was the first person in a long time who I really opened up to and let in. I thought she was doing the same to me. We were so insanely close. Then I did one dumbass thing, which I didn't realize was a dumbass thing, and she just turned cold on me. It's like, all the stuff she told me about how much she needed me, how much she loved me and how she would be devastated with me, just disappeared. I've spent the last several weeks trying to fix things, with her warming up a bit, then turning cold, then warming up, then turning cold. I can't put all the blame on her for this. Me going from begging and pleading for forgiveness, to yelling and screaming at her for abandoning me, and then back to the other one, made the situation way worse. But I was at such a low point, I was actually planning my suicide and I was just desperate to have her back. It was so painful and anger inducing that this person, who I gave everything to, didn't even care about it. I put her in front of me. I have suffered, so that I could make sure she didn't. I'm not an innocent angel in all of this. I'm clingy, I'm needy, I'm unstable and high maintenance. I also have extreme mood swings. But I also loved her. Fully and completely. I thought she knew this. 


I was willing to do anything it took to make her want to stay. I tried everything I knew. But it all failed. After one too many fights, things are at a definite end. There is no going back. Now I'm feeling so isolated and alone. The only person I could talk to, hates me. It feels like no one else is even trying to understand me.


To them, ""she's just some girl. Just move on."" They don't know her like I do. She's amazing, in every way. The day after I attempted suicide last March 25th, I was in the emergency room, alone. I was so scared and I had no one to talk to. She called and texted me as much as she could(she works as a waitress). Kept telling me that things will be okay and that she would be there for me. That’s what made her so special. When everyone else was freaked out and pushed away, she would run forward and try to help me. And I lost that.


All I can think about is that it took me 23 years to meet this one person who I got along with on such a deep level. Is it going to take another 23 to meet the next? And even if I do, they will never be able to replace her. It was nice to be in a relationship(whether it be friends, romantic, or familial) where I felt like I could just fully and completely be myself. I just miss her so much. The depression and stress I'm feeling from this is making my bipolar disorder spin out of control as well, which is just fucking annoying as well. When I met her, I was at a point where all I could think about was killing myself. I felt there was no hope. Nothing would get better. Now, without her, I'm basically back in that headspace and it sucks. I just feel so hopeless and empty. It hurts to breathe. Every morning, I wake up and I feel ok for about a minute. Then reality comes crashing in and I just cry till I can’t.


I do go to a psychiatrist, who is also a therapist. This is my 5th Psych and 3th Therapist in the last 2.5 years. They've tried over 2 dozen meds and a stupid amount of hours of therapy. Nothing has worked so far. I'm basically giving up at this point. I even told my psych that a few days ago. All this time and nothing has changed. Why should I believe it will now? I think any day now, I'll just end it all. I can’t go on without her.";3322;111;737;51;81;1085;332;880

1330;bipolarreddit;shenrougu;21/03/2019;"Waiting 6 months and counting for any mental health treatment in the UK I moved back to the UK from the US about two years ago. Back in the states I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and put on meds. When I moved back I thought I was ok and didn't need help. That turned out not to be the case and in August of last year I went to a GP and asked for anti-depressants. He said he wouldn't prescribe them to me and said it would be best if I see a mental health specialist and he did the referral. That took until January and in the meantime my depression got worse, I got fired from my job due to the symptoms and started putting weight back on. I would see my GP each month and beg for just a week or two of anti-depressants, he didn't budge. 

The referral came through in January and I got an appointment in the middle of February. It was just an intake appointment, the Doctor there said he didn't want to prescribe anything until I had blood work done, that was another 14 days. That's finally done and I now have an appointment booked in the middle of April where hopefully I'll get a prescription. 

I'm a big proponent of universal health care in the US but honestly, I don't understand how people in the UK with mental health issues survive. Waiting so long for something as simple as anti-depressants is shocking to me and has taken a huge toll. At this point I'm tempted to move back to the States as this would have been resolved in a week or two back there. I'm trying to hold it together but I'm starting to fall apart without treatment.

Right now I am in the midst of an especially bad depressive episode and I honestly I won’t fight any feelings if I want to kill myself and have a pretty solid plan when it happens. 

But I keep going, I get good grades, I get dressed everyday and most people are unable to see just how terrible I feel. 

I feel like I’m constantly put on the back burner, i would have to wait months to get into a therapist, I only see my doctor once a month at most, I’ve literally been told by the suicide hotline that there were more important calls to take. I feel like I can’t complain because from the outside I am doing f*cking awesome. If I did let the appearance slip everything would crumble around me, I’ve adopted the view that I’m either going to kill myself or not. Because experience says that no amount of help is going to matter. I don’t have friends, I don’t have family...it’s just me and I am not a good enough reason to keep going. I wish I had killed myself 10 years ago when I first starting really getting these feelings because it would have saved me a lot of pain.

1333;bipolarreddit;showercurtaintom;16/02/2018;"Definitely depression, but could there be something else too? (Thanks in advance!) I'm in my early 20's, currently a full-time student, currently seeing a counselor at my university for the depression I had from October-early February.

Some background: *Had an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive father growing up

*had cycles of depression as a teen but nothing as bad as this past fall, never before gotten treatment for it.

*used to have anger issues that I've been working on and have mostly gotten better.

*I used to be and still have worries in the back of my mind about some new super bug plague wiping out humanity, apocalyptic scenarios (before dystopian books were a thing-- or at least before it was on my radar), generally was and am irritable at times (can't stand foot/leg bouncers/tappers and gum smacking--as a result I feel pretty trapped in lecture halls). Something that also seems to stand out to me is that a year or two ago I got uncontrollably angry (literally shaking mad) at my roommate for no reason and had to go on a really long walk.

Currently: During my depressed period I had foggy cotton ball brain, couldn't concentrate, trouble sleeping and staying asleep, the irritability, suicidal thoughts all the time, racing thoughts.

Early last week I kinda started feeling better, one day everything looked more vivid. That sounds weird, but color had a touch more color, bright things were more bright. The next day I was so elated and have been ecstatic each morning. Waking up has been easy for the first time in a long time. I'm not riddled with self doubt or constantly wondering if I'm annoying people by talking to them. I'm actually excited for my future. I got cheap new clothes that fit so I don't have to wear my sweatpants every day any more.

Today I woke up early, did a bunch of errands, got more clothes, ran for the first time since September, did my usual short workout routine twice, and even went to an event at my university.

It's nice to finally be happy, but it feels wrong to be THIS happy so suddenly after having suicidal thoughts all day every day.

I meant to talk to my counselor about all this this morning but she was out sick---so instead I am asking for any personal experience or thoughts on this to see if I might be way off base or not here. ";1839;80;308;38;26;597;237;426
1334;bipolarreddit;showmethememez;24/03/2019;Are manic episodes somewhat forced? Like I mean when I’ve been manic it’s like I’ve lost track in thought. I have an underlying feeling like I’ve needed to change for a while. Like I’m not happy with who I am. So before I go manic or at least the early stages I’m thinking of shifting my mindset to a more positive energetic state. Whether that’s mania taking place or just me thinking myself into mania I don’t know. But it usually blows up into insanity where I have no self control. I feel like now I have a gf it’s less likely to happen because she gives me affirmation of who I am. I don’t feel the need to change who I am or “improve”. Maybe this isn’t what mania is like for you guys but I’m interested to hear what your opinions of how in control we are of it happening in the first place;630;22;133;8;15;216;98;168
1335;bipolarreddit;Shydudefrench3333;16/02/2018;"How do I take the next step to understanding myself? I'm using this account as it's kinda my throw away/ deep confession account. I'm going through some shit right now which is kinda relate to this, but for a while now I've been trying to understand if my 'normal' is really normal or if there's something I need to get checked out by a professional.

For as long as I can remember I've struggled to control my emotions in the context of what's around me, and most of the time I've been acting accordingly. If I'm at a party and I'm supposed to be having a good time, I might still be super upset about the fact that my favorite TV show has ended and what's going to fill that void. I attended my brothers funeral, carried the coffin even, and I wasn't that upset but people are watching so I tried my hardest to cry and look authentic. Later on of course I was distraught, but my emotions were always out of sync with reality.  

My mood guides everything I do. I'm of pretty normal intelligence I think, I went to school, am told that I'm pretty logical in my thinking, but I just can't seem to do the most basic things. I'll sometime go a couple of weeks without a shower (not proud to admit that) because when the opportunity presents itself to shower I'll be engrossed in something so deeply that the thought just gets shrugged of until next time, upon which is just repeated again. Sometimes that things I'm doing is just sitting down staring into space thinking, but it feels like important work. Other times I can't stand my own skin and shower three times a day. There's no normal middle ground!

My mood can often change at the drop of a hat too. I immerse myself in work and over extend what I can handle because it keeps my brain from being Moody or reacting to stuff around me, but someone will make a benign comment like they're going on holiday and if I get an envious thought in my head it just multiplies into this intense deep deep depression where I sneak out of work and drive somewhere (I'm trusted to manage my own time) to be alone and sink further and further. The scary thing is I sometimes embrace this mood, it's like I need it and it feels comfortable to be sitting in a car crying by myself. I'll carry this mood with me all day usually, acting normally in front of the family when I get home, and making an excuse to go to bed early because I know that also is the best chance I get to reset.  It's not working tonight though as it's 2am, and I've taken two tramadol to help sleep.

Other times I'm invincible. Right now despite a few big troughs in the last few days where I've been super depressed, I'm super super confident. For the first time in my career I've pushed myself and created a new role that is bigger than I ever thought I would get. It's a 'big' job, a Director role with a lot of responsibility, I'm so proud of myself I take on all these extra responsibilities and I'm totally overloading myself because I know I'm amazing. But I can't tell my family how happy I am because the mania I experience through the day rarely carried through to home. And if I'm not in the mood to be excited then I don't talk about it and my day was 'fine'.

I've done reading, enough to probably have the wrong idea about what I'm like. I fell like I have some level of bipolar but I don't want to go to my doctor and tell him that in case he just says that I'm normal and this is life pal, get used to it. I've never talked to anyone about this other than one close friend who is bipolar and we have similar thoughts.

The logical side in me says go to the doctor and explain myself, but I fear that the Dr won't be able to keep up with me when I talk. If I'm up then I can't get my words out quickly enough and just babble. If I'm down I'll think about every word and choose them so carefully I'll filter out crucial information because I don't want the Dr to think badly of me.

I want to be told that someone else is liked me, I want to hear that medication is there to help me, I want to stop being up and down all the time so I can focus on sitting out the other problems in my life like normal people do. I really just wanted to write all of this down, so I'm sure the post will get buried. ";3331;108;682;44;47;1119;346;870

1340;bipolarreddit;Sinop257;11/03/2019;"I quit smoking weed and my life has gotten way better I was diagnosed bipolar 2 about a year and a half ago, but I havn’t had the opportunity to go on meds yet because I’ve been moving around a lot, lost my insurance, bullshit like that. I started smoking weed for the first time during a manic episode about 6 months ago and smoked nightly no matter what my mood state was. If I was manic I would smoke all day everyday to feel less “up”, and if I was depressed or baseline I smoked to wind down at night or to distract myself from being depressed. I swore by weed and told all my friends it was actually making me more stable, but I see now that I was just numbing my symptoms. 

I was in a manic episode for the last month of these 6 months, this recent February. Every night during this month the smoking started giving me 3 hour panic attacks. It started slowly, maybe the first week I would just get paranoid about stuff like cops, and then I started hearing voices ontop of the paranoia, and then I slowly became convinced that I secretly had some medical issues that could kill me every second, and then finally the last week or two I would smoke and just become completely convinced I would die in my sleep. This even happened at a party, I didn’t even smoke that much but began hearing voices and had to leave the party early. It was humiliating. And being convinced you’re going to die is very traumatizing, especially when it happens night after night. I would be laying in my bed shaking, too high to even cry, and praying to god to forgive me for my sins since I was going to die that night, all while listening to classical music to try and calm down and hearing voices speak over the music. Finally I just said, why the fuck am I paying for weed, paying to have these panic attacks? So I threw it all away. 

This was about a week ago, and I’ve been a week sober for the first time in 6 months. I can already notice myself returning back to normal. I hadn’t realized how much weed was affecting my brain even when I wasn’t high. I have wayyy less anxiety, whereas when I was smoking I was wondering why I was suddenly developing anxiety. I wake up feeling refreshed and not still high from the night before. I don’t think every little ache and pain in my body is secretly cancer or something that’s going to make me magically drop dead. I’m not paranoid about cops busting in and arresting me for no reason. I was derealized for a long time and nothing felt real, and now everything feels real again. I hadn’t realized how fucked up weed was making me. 

I guess I wanted to post this because I’ve seen people on here say the same things I used to swear by, that weed is ok to self medicate with and that it actually reduces your symptoms. If you start getting paranoid when you smoke, you need to stop before it becomes psychotic panic attacks like i was having. I finally feel like I’m returning back to my normal self. I’m not even sad about having to quit like I imagine doing I’d be. I have literally no desire to smoke anymore, I’d do anything if it means I didn’t have to suffer another 3 hour panic attack of hearing voices and saying farewell to the world as I fall asleep and prepare to die. 

So yah, use weed if you want. But be aware that it gets bad very quickly, and likely is affecting you when you’re not high and you don’t even realize it. Take a week off and see what happens. ";2695;98;507;39;35;884;285;670

I’m teetering on the edge of a massive down at the moment while my pills even out (just upped dosage) and alongside the other crap I always get really bad problems with my hands and coordination. I feel like I can’t close my hands properly, as if all the heaviness goes into them, and when I try to concentrate on them they just go shaky. My shrink says it’s a normal symptom of depression (lack of coordination) which is fine; my problem is that I’m a piano teacher and every time this happens it makes it almost impossible to demonstrate exercises for my students, or convince them that good technique pays off. Not to mention I keep dropping/breaking things.

I'm 18 years old and I'm new to Reddit. When I was ten years old, I began to have depression. It wasn't severe, but I would often isolate myself from others and think about dying. Over time, my depression has gotten worse. However, at age 12 I began to have severe mood swings. Sometimes I would get very angry at everybody and everything around me for no reason. Sometimes it would last for a few days, and then I would go back to feeling ""stable"" or depressed. At age 15, I began to have three distinct and intense emotions that have taken over my life until this point. I rarely felt stable at that point. This feeling can occur for a week or less, I feel veryyyyyyy euphoric. I actually love life and everything around me. I feel very energetic and hyper like a five year old. I'm bouncing off the walls, and talk very fast because my thoughts race. Sometimes I can't sleep at night because my thoughts would never shut up. However, I have never done anything impulsive. I'm mostly abnormally energetic and euphoric. Then, I can switch to a depressive episode. These are always the longest, they can last for 4-6 months. At that moment, I'm extremely suicidal. I've never tried to commit suicide because I'm scared of failing but the craving is always there. I'm also hopeless, think that everybody hates me, and I feel so dead and emotionally tired. I sleep for 8-9 hours and I still feel tired. I can have a good day and still feel extremely miserable even though I know I shouldn't. Then, after my depressive episode, I can feel super angry and annoyed at everything and everybody for no reason. I just get super angry and lash out at anybody, and I don't know why. This lasts for a week or less. I have been to 4 therapists and none of them have really helped; I can't really afford one right now. My family aren't very supportive, it's taboo to talk about mental illness so they ignore my symptoms or brush them off as hormones since I'm a female. Could I be bipolar? Is it just hormones? your insight would be nice, I hope to a doctor soon to get a proper diagnosis but your insight will be helpful.

1353;bipolarreddit;SmeatyTee;26/03/2018;"Medication Frustration (Triiger warning- mentions suicide and ED) long I am new here (36 f) and have commented some, but this is my first post. 
I started a little over four years ago to try and find some relief from all the bad things going on in my mind. The only other time I had been to a Dr to help with my ongoing mental issues was when I was 22 and in college. A GP prescribed me Zoloft and up the dosage a couple times and then basically didn't schedule any follow up appointments. I basically went full out party mode and made terrible decisions, lacked impulse control, and was hyper sexual and engaged in a lot of risky behavior that I am still embarrassed about even today.  I eventually stopped taking the zoloft after about a year because my ex found out I was taking it and he said I had no right to be depressed because my life wasn't that bad(he was very emotionally abusive).
 My father was bipolar and we lost him to suicide and my sister is also bipolar. I had no idea that antidepressants alone could trigger a hypomanic/manic episode in some one with bipolar.
I knew that there was always something not right with me, I would have terrible bouts of depression. I attempted suicide at 14, luckily it didn't work, I just screwed up my stomach and I never told my parents. My family never talked about emotions. I didn't even know my dad was bipolar until after his death. My mom said he never believed it and refused to take medication for bipolar. 
Fast forward to about four years ago, I break down and tell my husband that I can't take it anymore and need help. I never admitted it to him, but I had a plan for suicide and it scared the shit out of me. On the outside my life seemed great, married to my husband who is amazing and the love of my life, we have two healthy kids(I also have an older children from my previous relationship), and I am a stay at home mom (which is something I really wanted). I had extreme anxiety and depression though. I started seeing a therapist who eventually said I needed to see a psychiatrist because I most likely needed meds because my issues were not going to be resolved with therapy alone. I started meds and did an inpatient program for Eating Disorders because I had an existing ED and felt myself falling back into old, bad habits in order to deal with my anxiety. The ED treatment was great, but my depression and anxiety were still out of control. 
I told my psychiatrist back my past with zoloft(I was finally realizing my behavior while taking it was probably caused by being on it alone). We tried a few antidepressants and they all made me feel irritable or angry. My Dr then starts adding mood stabilizers and antipsychotics to the mix. I look up more on bipolar disorder and start to think that maybe what's wrong with me, especially with my family history. I ask my Dr if she thinks I am bipolar and she says no because I don't have any type of hypomanic/manic episode and says she changed my diagnosis to mood disorder. We try a bunch of different combos, either they don't work or the side effects are so bad I can't handle them. All things she is prescribing me is medication for bipolar disorder. After three years she then starts prescribing me things I already tried and didn't work the first time. I got a new Dr. 
The new Dr asks right away if my old Dr thought I was bipolar after I give her the list of meds I have already tried. I see her a couple times and she says she thinks I am bipolar and my extreme attacks of anxiety that come along with not sleeping and being paranoid and suicidal are episodes of dsyphoric hypomania. I am now on my third med change with this Dr. All together I have been on 30 different meds in a little over 4 years. I am so frustrated. I am always med compliant, I really want something to work. I was just on Fetzima and lamotrigine. I am so irritable and can't sleep. So my Dr took me off the Fetzima because she thought it was what was causing me problems, I think it might be the lamotrigine. She said it was unlikely, but I had the same trouble with Vraylar and Rexulti. I am now on the lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine,  and mitrazapine. It's been a week off Fetzima and I am still extremely irritable and not sleeping well.

- Intimate relationships are topsy-turvy - I’ve been with my SO for 20 years now, but many times in our relationship I’ve had one foot in and one foot out - feel sure and committed, then feel like I’m with the wrong person ... marriage is needless to say very precarious atm because I have hurt my SO so much :(

1355;bipolarreddit;smlybright;01/01/2018;"Husband has just about blocked me out and refuses to deal with my mental health issues In some ways I can't blame him, but I need someone. Right now I have a good friend to talk to, but she really just doesn't get it. She never saw the bad years. My husband lived them.

I have been married almost 12 years. I know that I've been working hard to act better and my actions have been consistently much more thought out and I've been MUCH less volatile. I can let things go that I would have never been able to before. The other night my really stressed out husband (he went back to college and has just been grumpy the whole time) flew off the handle at me. Over something I said about Mexican Coca-Cola. Anyway, I just let him vent as he said things like, ""You just make me want to hate you."" And he referred to the last time I was in the hospital as the ""Smlybright show."" - making everything about me. He immediately referred to how selfish I am (which I really haven't been in a long time). 

This isn't even really him! I least I hope he hasn't turned into this guy!


I WAS selfish a long time ago. I was mean a long time ago, I was way too hypersexual a long time ago. And he has dealt with all of it. But he can't ever forgive me for anything. He has stopped being there when I really need him because he has just started blocking me out. He doesn't want to deal with me. I cry in private. I contemplate leaving or dying in private. I can't talk to him about these things anymore because ""we've had this conversation 100 times and you never remember what I tell you anyway and I have my own problems to deal with and I know how you feel because I'm depressed and have problems with that and I still am moving forward because somebody has take care of this family (we don't have kids. He means the pets. Which I definitely help with)."" 


We haven't had sex in about a year. For years prior, I felt like he just did it to get his obligatory sex in for the quarter. When we got married, we had sex all the time, and then I wanted it all the time and he didn't anymore. Then he says he felt like I was using him. Maybe I was. I would actually throw fits about it. Crying, screaming fits. Embarrassing but I'm being honest in this post.


Medicine has made me gain a lot of weight. He says it's not me. It's that he needs to feel like I am a safe place, mentally, physically, and emotionally. I still wonder if it's just my body. But I take my medicine because it works.


He says I get worse every year, but when I really look at myself, I know I'm doing better in a lot of really important ways. My relationships with other people (not so much my husband right now) have improved tremendously. I am not working anymore (well, some part time, but not a lot) but I'm slowly becoming more productive and balancing my functionality with my anxiety and the pressure it makes me feel. I bring in the money because I was medically retired from the military.


I think sometimes it's how you look at your illness. You can only really judge your own level of the illness affecting your life because you are the only one inside your brain. It's easy to forget the good times when we are feeling low. Last time I had some pretty bad depression I honestly couldn't think of any reason to keep going. I started to end things. But at the critical moment, I just had this strong feeling that I was checking out FOREVER. No more good days OR bad days, and that I could always off myself if I wanted to, so I'd live another day and reevaluate later. And things got better. And then worse, and then better. 


Any advice on any of this would be great. Sometimes I feel like I don't even like him anymore. A lot of times I feel like I love the old him, but not this guy who, at one time was always there, and now refuses to deal with me.";2970;95;617;44;68;974;287;766

Before I go into my questions, here's a bit about my symptoms/meds: I'm diagnosed as Bipolar 1 with rapid cycling. My current doctor has me on a very high dose of Lamictal, Wellbutrin, and Seroquel. Nothing seems to be helping right now, the episodes are staying just as intense (and quick) and I feel like I can't get any relief.

I wanted to ask all of you about your opinions on Lithium. I was seeing one psychiatrist for years that had asked about my opinion on Lithium and I said I didn't want to go on it. She dropped it after that and decided to raise my Lamictal. It helped temporarily. I ended up relocating kind of far away from her, so I decided to see a new doctor. She also asked me about going on Lithium, but I'm still really apprehensive. 

My concerns are centered around the fact that my grandmother actually suffered a Lithium overdose and she's never been the same since then. I'm so paranoid that that will happen. 

Has anyone with rapid cycling had success on Lithium? Does it really do the ""zombifying"" thing people talk about? The event with my grandma happened a few years ago, are doctors more cautious with the blood testing and everything now? 

TL;DR my doctors keep prescribing Lithium but I'm very apprehensive, has it been successful for other people with rapid cycling?";1176;59;192;23;24;383;155;272

Two days ago I was told by my therapist that I could be diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and recommended meds.

I never realised that I might have something like this. If anyone would be so kind and answer my very clueless questions, that would be amazing. 

My cycles of hypomania and depression are long (?) so I tend to have a few months of depression and then one or maybe two months of hypomania. When I am in my depressed state I sometimes feel for a very short time that I will switch phases into hypomania again because I feel energised, happy and productive. It only lasts for a few hours maximum and then goes back to the depression, though. More often than not it happens in the middle of the night. Is this possible that there are smaller cycles in big cycles (I hope this is understandable as I am not an English native speaker, sorry.) or could this be a sign that I actually am not bipolar?

So, I had an issue on Friday evening. I had what my husband thought was a seizure but the emergency room physician said was a dystonic reaction likely to my medication (seroquel 100mg) which I’ve been on for about two years at varying doses. 
Aside from that I’ve been having odd neurological symptoms for about the same amount of time that I’m having investigated by a neurologist currently. 
So, I’m seeing a new psychiatrist and at the request of the treating doctor Friday they have come to the decision to taper me off of seroquel, and add a mood stabilizer. I’ve never tried a mood stabilizer. This is the plan so far. She also affirmed my bipolar diagnosis made by the last psychiatrist I saw and also suspects I suffer from PMDD. But, that’s another story. 

Week 1
50mg of seroquel nightly 
450mg of depakote 

Week 2
25mg of seroquel nightly 
900mg of depakote 

Week 3
Stop seroquel 
(Start 1/2 tablet of trazodone for sleep as needed)

Then last summer they suddenly stopped working, I had my first hypomanic episode, and everything seems to have changed. This illness feels like such a heavy burden everyday, and I have virtually no coping mechanisms. I had to give up alcohol and weed, as I was becoming dependent on the former, and the latter started bringing on paranoia and psychotic episodes. I’m in my last semester of undergrad, and seriously don’t know how I’ll make it to completion. I have to write a thesis which, as you may imagine,  is like fighting the final boss in a video game that I don’t even want to play. On top of my other schoolwork, I’m just not sure how to hang on. My psychiatrist has suggested inpatient care, but if I don’t finish school this semester I won’t be able to afford to go back (my financial aid will run out). This disease is new for me, and I’m scared. I feel that if I can somehow power through the last two months of this semester I can then truly seek proper help for my condition. Anyone have any words of advice/strategies to just power through the illness for a period of time?

I’ve been having these symptoms, I guess symptoms of depression, and I don’t know how to deal with them. Part of me wants to take a low dose stimulant medication... but I’m at risk for mania and psychosis. I just wonder if anyone else deals with this, how they deal with it, do they talk to their doctor about it? How do you talk to your doctor about it? What if doctors don’t take you seriously? My GP and psychiatrists haven’t taken this side of things seriously, and it’s been going on for years. I’m 33, not employed, not in education, not in a relationship, nothing going on in my life, no motivation, I struggle to focus enough even to have a conversation (I struggle to find words), I can’t focus on cleaning and don’t have the energy for it, and this has been going on for years. 

What makes this more pressing is that my mom is in poor health, her memory is failing at an increasingly rapid pace, my family’s financial situation is increasingly dire, and I need to step up and take on much more of our shared burdens. I do receive SSI disability but I never worked long enough for SSDI so it isn’t much, and not enough. My brother is also mentally ill and not working. My mom has been carrying all our burdens her whole life but it’s time for her to be in retirement and focus on her own wellbeing. 

What can I do? I feel like I’m missing that part of me that cares about getting up. My energy is almost bedridden level, like someone who has a serious physical disease. The GP tells me I have slight anemia (and I take iron pills) but otherwise they say nothing is wrong. 

I took like 2.5 milligrams of Ritalin the other day that I got from a friend, after my dad berated me about not doing anything. After that, I felt a little jittery but was able to get up and walk around, and I even went to the gym the next two days in a row, and did some basic chores around the house. I had better days than I’ve had in a really long time, and didn’t really suffer any side effects (besides some initial jitters)... But I know that this is playing with fire. Before my bipolar diagnosis, I had a prescribed stimulant for a while to study, and while it helped me study (and clean), I also dealt with huge amounts of anxiety, anger, and possibly a mixed episode... (idk how I would describe it... very agitated, speedy, anxious, angry mental state though). 

I’m very conflicted and confused, because I need something to change for me. I have a psychiatrist appointment today, and I just feel like the fatigue, anhedonia and cognitive impairment is a huge issue for me, but I’ve been trying to communicate this for years and don’t know how to.

So I have bipolar 1 with psychotic features as per my diagnoses and I wanted to share some good news with this wonderful community. I will preface this by saying that after I got out of the hospital over a year ago (pretty long and arduous stay around 4 months) I was lost and I had no optimism about my future once I got my phone back I started googling med related things and this subreddit would always come up. I started to realize slowly that there are a large number of people with bipolar living productive and stable lives and that exhibit linear thinking. I thought I was relegated to being acutely ill for the rest of my life and that. I would have at least two major manic episodes a year that would always get me hospitalized. I will spare some of the details about these episodes because they are honestly a bit embarrassing and I imagine they could be triggering (drug usage). Anyways it has been over a year since my last manic episode and I haven't even experienced hypo-mania in the interim. Over the last year I went from living in group homes and care facilities to finally going back to college and getting A's and went back to work. I have been living in my own apartment for 5 months and have never had a period of stability this long. I think what actually worked for me was staying on medication for more than 6 months and working with a treatment team. I am actually really happy with my psychiatrist from Stanford and actually appreciate his style. He doesn't just shove pills in my face and actually takes over an hour to ask about how im doing and then during the last 5 minutes we talk about meds. He was even willing to take me off of my monthly injection and switch me to a lower dose oral dosage which seemed shocked me as the shot was the one thing that I would consistently take due to non-compliance. This made me realize that he trusted me and after that I started trusting him. My relationships are really solid now too and I have actually kept a friend instead of burning all my bridges like before. I actually got a job volunteering at one of the residential facilities I was a client at and this really helps to give me a feeling of fulfillment. I also started making music again which really helps as well. Lastly I think that staying sober (with the exception of the occasional beer with family) has been a huge factor in my stability.

Everyone’s got different skills, interests, and goals, but I was wondering if you could share aspects of your work environment that make a difference for you, for better or worse. 

My SO has bipolar DO and is looking for work. He found something that seemed good on the face of it - turned out they wanted him to do rotating shifts, ie a month straight on nights. Between that and the long commute, it was a less than ideal setup. I’m wondering what other environmental factors are worth considering when looking at potential jobs. (Could include management style, size of organization - big orgs might have decent HR staff and can afford to handle sick day requests, but maybe the right smaller employers could offer a better culture ? Anything you can think of.)

He’s looking at sales or customer service as possibilities  - I think  sales especially would suit his personality in many ways, but wonder how the stressors might affect him (competition with coworkers for commissions , managing disappointment, dealing with complaints, etc... he’s very personable and likes people, so I can see that working for him, it’s  just the other stuff i worry might stress him out.

Have you had this experience? I don’t understand why the price would raise by more than $100 in less than a month. I didn’t switch insurance or anything. I called my insurance company and they just said “the price of the medication rose this year”.

1399;bipolarreddit;Stateofdespair;06/03/2018;"Bipolar Boyfriend Hi everyone, I'm new here so please go easy on me if I make a mistake.

My boyfriend (whom I've been dating for over one year) has bipolar disorder. When we started dating he was in a hypomanic phase, luckily he got out of it in a month or so, instead of it escalating into full blown mania or another psychosis. He's had psychosis several times in his life, and it's been difficult for him sometimes. He needs to take medication daily.


I have some questions about certain behaviour and would like to know if this is common with people who have bipolar disorder.


-Being indecisive. He'll say one thing one moment and when he's with other people, they'll be able to change his mind in a minute. He'll tell me/promise me one thing one moment, but then completely abandon those promises and stop caring.

-It's very easy to talk him into doing something, that he usually wouldn't have done on his own. I'm talking: drinking way too much and suddenly just smoking when he quit smoking for months. He also has a hard time when I ask him about this type of behaviour or when I get upset.

-He used to be very sure about our future but ever since a couple of months ago, he's been doubting things and he hasn't been sharing his feelings with me, or telling me how he feels, even when I ask him. He's tried to break up with me two months ago, to which I said ""are you sure? Do you want to give it all up?"" (Calmly and respectfully not mad) and he ended up not breaking up with me. He's been threatening to break up with me again.

-He often gets really tired and sleeps till late afternoon, he's been doing that for months. He lost motivation to look for a job as well. He had a job interview but he cancelled last minute, last week. He was too anxious to go. I often feel as if he's just very insecure.

-He'll say that the reason he never responds when I'm talking to him (irl), is because he just can't think clearly and his mind is just blank. (However I think this could be because he doesn't like to be confronted when he's lied to me)


I've never experienced him in a depressive manic state before, and he doesn't feel anxious when he's outside, he doesn't feel as if they're spying on him and stuff. Which he definitely did when he was experiencing hypomania. He believes the craziest conspiracies when he's actually manic, so I don't know what this all means.

It would help me if y'all could really enlighten me on this subject. I was hoping to talk to his therapist about this tomorrow, but he has been ignoring me and suddenly is hanging out with friends (he's out with one friend who's done hard drugs, right now). He says he's never done harddrugs but this friend does get him to smoke and drink too much when they're out together.

We had fights several times last week and yesterday, but he is just refusing to make up, ignoring me and instead just seeing his friends or he'll sleep over at his parents' place. (Even though I don't live with him, so he could just stay at his own place, but he always feels the need to go to his parents, which is why I think he's insecure.) Any advice? What do I do and what do I say to him? It's been difficult for me to understand everything which is why I'm here. It's also been difficult because him changing his mind constantly is so confusing to me, I never know what he actually wants because he'll constantly tell me something else.";2681;99;541;53;46;878;267;676

The psychiatrist told me I was not a candidate because I was not depressed but had bipolar type 2. I got a second opinion and he also confirmed bipolar type 2. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I got my diagnosis, I've kinda gone off the deep end. On one side, I got an answer to my problem and a potential solution. But on the other side, I am now unable to see any part of me with any normalcy. Everything about me is now seen with discernment and that is causing me to lose my mind, so to speak. I don't want to call it a mental health crisis, but that's what it feels like.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 27 and have obviously lived with this most of my life, but I always just thought I had depression that I was able to come in and out of depending on my lifestyle choices and I was probably a bit ADHD, loud, laughed too much etc... But now when I'm in a ""good"" mood, I just think I'm hypomanic.

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor gave me a mood stabilizer that caused extremely vivid hallucinations and I was scared to sleep... I would stay up all night just because I knew I would wake up with crazy hallucinations - I saw my girlfriend turn into a wearwolf and bite my neck. CRAZY things like that...

Under the new team, I requested that I had my diagnosis looked into again.

I’ve met with this new team a few times now but the most recent letter from the minutes of that meeting mention the word euthymic three times. 

The psych also stated during that meeting that my previous psychosis ‘could of been bipolar’. 

I’ve researched the word euthymic and I can only find a correlation to Bipolar and no results on euthymia with Borderline. 

I’m here because I’d like some insight into what they may mean by this ‘euthymic state’. Well, it says euthymic then later on in the mental state part it says ‘euthymic reactive state’. 

Please help shed some light on this, I’m clueless.

1412;bipolarreddit;SufficientOutcome;12/02/2018;"How to convince someone that I'll be okay? I've spent my entire life managing my ups and downs. I've figured out strategies for waiting out the lows and have handled it myself for as long as I can remember. It's made school difficult at times, but I've done my best to keep my shit together and I'm in a graduate program that I absolutely love and working with people who are amazing. I know how to meet deadlines even in my worst episodes and I've learned how to harness the (very rare) hypomania for productivity. 

I accidentally confided in my supervisor and told him that I was dealing with a particularly bad bout of depression (not my worst though). This spiralled into him being excessively worried about me and reaching out to other people and him phoning/texting me to check up on me. I've had moderate suicidal thoughts in past, but I can usually handle them (or I know to go to a doctor immediately if not). 

I was emotionally exhausted but doing okay before he started worrying about me. I'm afraid that his concern is pushing me deeper into this depressive episode though because he's made it feel more serious than usual. He was worried I was suicidal and that made me think about suicide more than usual and freak myself out about it. (I ended up on the phone with him at 2AM crying because of it...)

The thing is, I know it passes. I deal with it all the time. I know my worst-case measures and I'm prepared to use them. But, the crucial thing is that I've always dealt with it myself. On one hand, I get where he is coming from on the ""you shouldn't have to go through this alone"" thing, but the fact that he's referring to me as a ""student in crisis"" makes me scared and makes me feel more fucked up/depressed. I'm not sure how I can convince him that I'll be okay. I'm also worried that I've fucked up the only good thing in my life (my academic stuff) by confiding in him. I've resolved to take the steps he wants (talking to X person, checking in, etc.) to show that I'm committed to living/dealing with this shit and that I am accepting his help, but it's so difficult when I just want to make an appointment with my psychiatrist and deal with this in my own way without everyone knowing. (Also, I feel like shit for making him worry and also for ruining his perception of me.)

Does anyone have any recommendations for quelling his worry and coming back from this gracefully?

My psych doesn't know which one I have, but ever since then I've been taking lithium along with Wellbutrin. He's upped my dosage which ended up in me feeling sick, so I haven't been taking meds for almost 4 weeks. I've been feeling quite.... weird. I don't want to kill myself, but I do think about how life is meaningless and I dissociate quite a lot to escape my dull reality. I've gotten my attention span back and I have a will to read books again. I was feeling a little manic earlier, but now I feel ????stable???? is that the word?

I have luckily been at baseline with very few manic/depressive episodes for about 2/3 years. But, lately I have become more cognizant of a background feeling of depression that always seems to be present. It is really more of the physical feelings rather than the emotional feelings (e.g. listlessness, fatigue, body aches, flat affect, etc.). I don’t feel “depressed”, but I have been depressed enough times in my life to know what the symptoms are. Does anyone else experience this?

However, I am suffering side effects related to lithium (weight gain, acne, diarrhea, memory/focus issues, dry skin, drowsiness/slugishness) and want to reduce my dose back to 300mg.

However, I can't find much research on levels that low. I'm meeting with my doctor next week, but in the meantime just reduced it and feeling more alive.

1418;bipolarreddit;summfree;14/03/2019;"A big move has me stuck in a mixed episode, not sure how to cope. Hi, r/BipolarReddit

I just moved back home to be with my family for the next 6 months and I'm trying to figure out how to cope until getting to my new pdoc. 

Surprisingly I have been stabilized on only 12.5 mg of Lamictal (extremely rare-- my body is intensely sensitive to meds, substances, etc.) for the last couple of months. My day to day routine was rather consistent though, so there wasn't that much to throw me off. It's helped more so with my co-morbid BPD mood swings.

But after an 11 hr stressful care ride, change of environment, change of sleep schedule, and moving away from my boyfriend? I'm lost. I'm waking up in a deep depression, don't want to shower, don't want to eat. Then when my loud and boisterous family gets me out of the house I start feeding off of their energy and won't stop talking, become obnoxious at restaurants, speed home, racing thoughts and sweating like crazy, stay up all night, then repeat the next day. Luckily I haven't been doing anything too extreme (yet) but I don't know what to do in the meantime, even right now I feel panicked and sweaty and confused yet worn out and can't find the will to do anything. Not to mention I've been feeling intensely lonely even though I am near my family. 

I start work on Monday, which I'm hoping can add in some needed structure to my day, but at the same time I'm nervous to be adding another facet of change to my life and sending me down more of a spiral. 

I want to get out and distract myself during this weird state but I really can't find the footing and I'm afraid if I stay around my family I'll get worse. 

I don't see my new doctor for another couple of weeks, what can I do in the meantime? ";1377;42;284;22;23;444;197;352

If someone did horrible things while manic: 

Cheating on spouse, sleeping with prostitutes, breaking up your family, verbal/mental/physical abuse 

Should they be responsible for their actions? What if they didn’t have insight that their disease caused them to behave so abnormally? 

My husband was recently diagnosed as having bpd w psychotic features. For the past year he’s made my life a living hell. 

He’s currently still unstable and delusional. He’s been on treatment w antipsychotics for 3 weeks (almost 4) but delusions are still present.  His delusions were all centered around me being unfaithful. This lead him to act extremely abnormal as a result. 

I wonder what will happen if he ever gains insight, is it possible to recognize how his thinking has been ? For any or you who have experienced delusions firsthand, were you able to look back after the fact and realize your thoughts were not consistent with reality? 

Because he thinks/thought I was unfaithful he searched for endless women on dating sites and hook up apps (while he was manic/hyper sexual) He’s now involved with another woman, and told her he’s never been married and doesn’t have children. 

I know if he were stable, he never would’ve behaved this way. I don’t know what to do anymore or how to help!

1422;bipolarreddit;sunshine3881;08/04/2019;"Bipolar and PPD Hi everyone. I’m really, really struggling today. I was diagnosed with bipolar ll in 2010. I gave birth to my first child in June of 2016. While pregnant I was on a very low dose of my medications I had taken before I became pregnant. We were not trying to get pregnant but ended up conceiving on our wedding night. After giving birth I started suffering from PPD. I hated my daughter, wanted absolutely nothing to do with her. I sought treatment at a private hospital that had a mother-baby ppd program. I had my tubes tied to prevent another pregnancy and I thought that was a great idea. I thought I was one and done.  After the tubal ligation I had a lot of other complications which lead to my having a full hysterectomy. 

I guess the reason that I’m struggling is because I so badly want to have another child.  I want my daughter to have a sibling. I want to bless my home with another little blessing. My daughter is now the biggest joy in my life.  Of course I still struggle with my bipolar. I’m on a constant roller coaster. I do know that if you have ppd with an early pregnancy you are bound to have it with one that follows. 

I honestly don’t know why I’m posting this and not sure if I will go through with posting it.  I can’t talk to my husband about this because he definitely does not want another child.  I’m just so heart broken today";1081;51;197;20;24;364;142;268

For the last ~5 years I’ve had 6-7 months straight of feeling depressed, high anxiety, suicidal thoughts (with plans), isolation, and a general urge to just shut myself off from the world.

So I've had a BP 2 diagnosis for many, many years. I was extremely, badly depressed towards the beginning I suppose you could call it. At the time, Lamictal helped me beyond my wildest expectations. It gave me many years of being able to live and work productively.

However, I’ve been wondering a lot lately whether or not I’m just experiencing an intense level of anxiety/insecurity or if this crosses into the area of what would be considered a delusion. I haven’t had any of the more obvious signs of delusions that I’ve read about on here (i.e. thinking I’m God or somebody else or an informant, etc.), but I most definitely feel all the time like I can tell 95-100% exactly what people are thinking about me to the point that it hinders me from functioning in many instances. For example, I will literally coup myself up in my room for days/weeks because I feel like I absolutely know exactly what my roommates or friends/family/professors are thinking of me in these high and low emotional states and I don’t want to even confront them for this reason. I’ve even accused my mom of basically “thinking her thoughts” too loud at me or even lashing out when I think she’s judging me or thinking something extremely negative. She’ll obviously say things like I’m assuming way too much and I have no clue what I’m talking about and I still don’t believe her. 
 
I know logically when I think about this that it’s ridiculous but part of me also lets it affect me to the point that I will hide myself or freak out about it. The fact that I’m partially able to understand that this obviously isn’t the true case is what dissuades me from calling it a delusion, but it’s also so strong of a fear and “observation” that it makes me wonder. What do you think? Has anybody else experienced anything this? ";1413;69;255;37;19;472;183;337

I’ve been in a really deep depressive episode for a couple weeks now and I’m not doing great. I went to therapy this morning promising to be completely honest with my therapist, and I was. I told her I was feeling suicidal, had a plan, but probably wouldn’t act on it. I totally expected to be sectioned but she’s great and understood why I was saying I wouldn’t act on it. It was a good session but it left me feeling pretty shitty. Today was my day off so I didn’t really have anything to do all day so I came home from therapy and surprise surprise got drunk.

I guess that was suspicion because about two minutes after I got in my car the police came rolling by, but didn’t see me. I sat there for a while and then drove home. 
I don’t really know what to do. I feel suicidal but I guess I’m not that bad since I decided not to jump.

My brother has had bipolar depression since he was a teenager, he's mid-20s now and still living with our retired father. Recently, he ""attempted suicide"" by jumping off a 15-foot balcony and breaking his feet, leading to hospitalization (and inpatient psych). Given the background context below, what would you do?

* He has talked about and threatened suicide hundreds of times

* This is the third time he's been hospitalized in the last 90 days (previously for psychosis and suicidal threats)

* Each time, he's released after 3-5 days after he begins to act normal and wants to go home

* Our father is a psychiatrist who desperately wants to help him, and has not been willing to ""kick him out"" of the house

* He has not been willing to consider longer-term inpatient psychiatric options (I don't know what options are available?) and because he always has had my father's home to return to, the hospital is always able to discharge him

* He has seen at least 20 psychiatrists in the last decade, and taken hundreds of different medications, with zero success

* He has received a year of ECT treatment, with significant memory loss and only temporary depression relief

* He dropped out of high school due to a combination of social phobia, depression, sensory issues, and rage issues

* He has never applied for a job

* He sometimes wishes to move into his own apartment, but that gets derailed by his constant suicidal threats, changing his mind about everything, easily becoming frustrated and overwhelmed, and at least for now, he can't even walk...

How do you end a revolving door of 5-day long emergency room and inpatient psychiatric visits? Is my father's home being open to him actually hurting his chances of recovery? Would being barred from returning home force him to choose between homelessness and long-term inpatient care?

My concern is, is that while there has been improvements in herself, as much as less self hatred, which is something she struggled with. More recently she has been far more verbally violent and sometimes gets physical as well in herself and on me. The latter only once, the former a number of times. 

This isnt her nature, before she was diagnosed with depression and before the event that triggered it she was wonderfully sweet, caring, comforting and affirming of me, but now when she is in one of these phases of what seems like BPD all hell breaks loose if I say the wrong thing, it just triggers her, and I am unsure of how to deal with that, how do I deal with that.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory:

I lost my job at the beginning of January. That (on top of things that I was already dealing with and at the time I was unmedicated) I ended up flipping my sh\*t and ended up in the mental health unit for a week. During that week they got me medicated with Lamictal and Latuda, stabilized and finally  I was discharged with a follow up appointment with a pdoc already scheduled for me. 

The problem is that my insurance ran out at the end of January. I currently have no job (not for a lack of trying, I just bomb the interviews horribly) and no way to pay for a doctor's visit and my local resources can't do anything for me for a couple of months due to lack of openings through my county's community services board (I don't know what the term is for other places but this is set up to handle mental health stuff for uninsured or under insured people). 

My awesome therapist decided to keep seeing me even though the insurance is now cancelled, and my primary doctor is going to work with me to get me taken care of as well. My therapist, the pdoc in the hospital, and my primary care doc have all advised me against going back to work right now and are urging me to seek temporary disability benefits as they all feel that I need a year or two to get back to a functioning level and I hated to admit it, but I agree with them because I am completely unable to handle leaving my house most of the time now days. They all told me to go to social services and apply for Medicaid so that I can keep going to the doctor which I am working on as well as trying to figure out how to get disability.

 I have no insurance or money to pay for a pdoc appointment (first appointment as a new patient is base priced at $300) and medications; the Lamictal I can get without insurance for around $15 while the Latuda is about $1500. The makers of Latuda offer a discount program themselves but it's only up to $600 which still leaves me about $900 to pay out of pocket so that does me no good.In the meantime, I have no idea how to get my medications refilled and I know that I can't just stop taking them.

The pdoc in the hospital said the Latuda would only be for a month and then he advised that I stop the Latuda and go fully on the Lamictal 2 times a day. Of course that would ultimately be left up to the pdoc I was scheduled to see.

Should I contact my primary doc and see if she will write the Rx as the pdoc said it should be be after the month of Latuda was up? Is there anything that anyone knows of that will help me get low cost or no cost help?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance. I hate to ask here but I don't know where else to turn at this point and I don't want to annoy my doc or therapist until I have an idea of the direction that I should be going in first.

1472;bipolarreddit;TheAGH;16/03/2018;"Lamictal and Memory Loss Hey everyone!  I'm 17 here, going on 18.  I first started taking lamictal in early 2016 to treat my depression, but only started taking it consistently a few months ago.  I used to just take whenever I'd wake up, which could range from anywhere from the early morning to late in the day, but the only noticeable effect that it produced was that if I missed a dose, my body would physically crave it.  

A few months ago, I began taking it at a regimented time everyday, as to give it the opportunity to properly regulate in my system.  About a month into doing that, I started to feel different.  I've always been one of the sharper kids, praised for my vocabulary and my writing ability (which may not come off in this post, but I'm really just looking for help here).  It's all that I really had to pride myself on at a young age and it carried over into just being a part of my identity; but over the past two months, I've just felt like I've been losing myself.  I struggle to keep up in conversation, my word find seems to come and go, and I just feel slow.   I know that I'm functioning at a technically normal level, but I feel like a piece of me is missing.  I've also been having terrible mood swings, going from happy, to sad, to complacent, to ragingly angry within about twenty minutes.  I know that I'm functioning at a technically normal level, but I feel like a piece of me is missing.

My biggest concern, though, is that I'm experiencing brain damage, as I've banged my head up a little bit.  This started getting really bad around the same time I started better regulating my dosage and I'm not discounting that as a possibility, making it hard for me to figure out if it's my medication or if I just destroyed myself for the rest of my life.  At the same daily dosage for nearly two years, I've never experienced anything like this, so my question would be this: Was my irregular dosing the reason that I wasn't experiencing these things earlier and will these effects go away after I wean myself off? 

EDIT: I've had a significantly worse sense of humor over the past month.  I know that this sort of thing is common, but can lamictal actually make you more serious? I can't seem to find anything on the subject.";1773;64;322;42;25;612;210;435
1473;bipolarreddit;thebowski;27/03/2019;"Pot induced my mania, is this the new normal? Is bipolar mania precipitated by marijuana use typically one off, or a ""new normal"" in the cycle?  Am I likely to experience full-blown mania without medication?

Some background:

After a period of minor depression I reverted to old habits and smoked some marijuana which caused my first manic episode.  I spent some time in a psych ward and was given lithium and zyprexa, which didn't fully suppress my manic state.  After a couple months in hypomania, I gave my zyprexa to someone else I'd med who couldn't afford them.  I thought I'd be fine, with just a week until my next refill.  I was wrong, and went manic, totalled my car, and ended up back in the psych ward.  Now I'm dealing with the fallout from this event.

I'm 26, and generally high functioning.  I was an alcoholic for a few years and have been sober for about 4 years (it runs in my family).  I'd smoked pot before, but not often because it would make me feel very anxious and make my thoughts race.

Is this extreme episode of mania my new normal or is it likely a one-off ?  I'd never experienced them before.  In fact, I don't think I'd ever really experienced general hypomania before, only excitement related to specific projects or areas of interest.

I'm unable to find much online about this, here's one:

&gt;Clinicians agree that cannabis use can cause acute adverse mental effects that mimic psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

&gt;[...]

&gt;Cannabis abuse prior to development of bipolar disorder has a significant effect on first-episode mania and on the course of the disease. Another study reported that using cannabis at baseline can significantly increase the risk for manic symptoms during follow up.

I'm currently undiagnosed (getting there.. why does it take so long to see a pysch?), but I had one of those ""oh shit, I was so crazy I convinced myself I wasn't crazy"" moments a few months ago after I checked myself into a psychiatric hospital in the middle of the night while going through a month of full blown mania without really realizing what it actually was. I didn't want to get hospitalized so I kinda lied my way out, Idk why. I probably shoulda gone but I just wanted to talk to someone and in the moment the idea of a hospital bed was the last thing I wanted. Feels fuckin bad man. I didn't ask for this shit. I really should have seen the signs earlier though. I was such a bright kid and then when I was like 16 I just dropped off the face of the earth. Or when I was 19 and I drank myself into a near coma and flipped my car 3 times and walked away without a scratch, or that time I dropped out of college suddenly to become a plumber after sleeping 16 hours a day for months,  or when I was drinking myself into blackout daily just to cope with the pain. 

 I am so very fortunate to have a wonderful girlfriend that cheers me up when I am down, but sometimes she gets upset when im ""away"". Sometime's I'm ice cold. I just check out from the world. Nothing gets in, and nothing gets out. It's like an emotional hostage situation. It might be for a day, it might be for a week, but I'm just gone. I just get so wrapped up in all of my racing thoughts. They kill me. I suffered from some serious childhood abuse so I often flashback into those memories (definitely have a ptsd diagnosis coming as well) and then before I know it, it's an hour later and my already shitty mood is just shot to oblivion. I am so. fucking. depressed.

 I've moved to a new city a year and a half ago and I don't have a single friend in my area besides roommates/girlfriend. Honestly, it scares me to talk to anyone I haven't known for years at this point. My desire to engage in friendships is shot. I would honestly rather fuck off in my room and work on my projects all day and night. Sometimes I feel like code is the only thing in this world that makes sense. It just is, or it isn't. There's no grey. And that brings me to the next thing...

Ever since I realized that there is actually something wrong with my head, I have been lower than low. I pride myself in my mind and my work. I refuse to be limited.  I just can't accept that for some months of the year (when I'm low), my critical thinking is shot. It makes me feel so fucking useless. And somehow, despite all of this, I am doing relatively well for myself. So there's that I guess. I do seriously wonder how long I'll be able to keep this up. I just can't really help but feel that there is just no fucking point to anything anymore besides my work. I don't feel as if I could ever possibly achieve happiness, so I spend my time working towards some stupid never ending monetary goal. In mania, I have a hard time discerning what is real. The one thing that I can understand is that money is the only god, and with enough money you can do anything. So I pursue this because it is a constant, providing stability above all else. If I could fuck off to some island with my girlfriend and enough books/a working computer, I don't think I'd ever come back. I feel different. I'm losing my ability to blend in. I just act.. very eccentric to put it in a good way. And I feel like its becoming noticeable. 

I guess that's the end of my ramble. I feel embarrassed when I open up like this. Sometimes I find it hard to believe there are people just like me who are struggling just as much..... It's a lonely world.";2880;102;599;44;64;950;320;747

I run myself hard. 1.5 jobs with complex advocacy/legal-y components. For the last five years, I went to school part time while I worked one or two jobs full time. I over commit myself constantly. And that is through hypo-mania and depression. I push. I always push myself. And I may have just run myself down.  

So now I'm off work with an unknown return date and waiting for her to call in drugs for me. Lithium is on the top of the list. I've never been on it before, and I've heard good and bad things. 

It just sort of is what it is. I'm trying to treat this like a vacation for now. I do what I want, when I want. I almost feel like I have a free pass to eat all the cookies because I'm crazy (in a comedic, not dangerous to self and others kind of sense).

This is very surreal for me. I have been in this same general zone before when I was a teenager, but I was in the US then and they still made me go to school and perform.

Indecisive as F. I CHANGE MY MIND ALL THE TIME. I can't seem to relate to anything...
It's really bad. I can't stay at a job, as soon as I get an idea, let's say traveling or doing something else, I quit my job, leave my apartment, and the idea just slowly dies.  Then I start aaaall over again, finding a job, a new place to stay, new idea, BAM. Same vicious circle.

I have mood-swings like crazy. Depressed periods/days, and not so depressed periods/days.
On my depressed periods/days I; 
Tend to isolate myself, disable all my social media, turn off my phone. 
I get irritable and angry about the smallest things, for no reason. 
My creativity/confidence level goes to 0, so it's like i've never played on my guitar before, or sung a song. 
And of course, the overthinking everything like crazy, it gets so bad that I can't even answer a ""simple"" yes or no question, without having to overthink it. And I always know that as soon as I answer the question, I would/will change my mind straight away.

On my good days/periods, I get crazy.. hyper and active?
Spend money on random stuff
Get 1000 of ideas, but never follow through with one of them.
Confidence is SKY HIGH, and I can do everything. 
I sleep 3-4 hours max, and im good to go. 

Relationship wise; I really quickly lose interest. All of a sudden, I just cut off contact without letting the person - Or i do the opposite, and get way to clingy and deep. 



So yesterday, I've simply had enough. I went to the doctor, told him all this, and he referred my to a psychiatrist, which I will be seeing in 4-5 weeks...  He couldn't tell me 100% what it was, and im just clueless on what to do. Can anyone of you relate to any of this?

They tell me this is mania even though i dont experience the typical symptoms like endless energy. Well ive been put on a latuda (an antipsychotic) and depercote to combat the delusions. My problem is im horridly depressed now. I spoke to my doctor about what we can do for depression and he said whatever treatment we pick its going to be a long time till it works. My question is what treatments have been effective for managing your bipolar depression? This is a long battle thats starting to feel unsurmountable.

1485;bipolarreddit;TheLonelyJelly;18/03/2018;"3.5 years diagnosed, 1 official year off meds.. I was diagnosed right after losing my mother at 18. When initially diagnosed, I got put on a cocktail of meds hoping something would work. I was watched closely to try and figure out the cycle of my mood swings. I had a regular therapist and a psychiatric nurse I saw every week trying to figure it out. I stuck with it until a year and a half ago and decided being on a fluctuating list of meds(that may or may not work/have ugly side effects) sucked. 

Until a year ago I was in a pretty toxic relationship too, of course half of that due to myself. I had no idea what bipolar was, or what it meant, until I was diagnosed. I’ve since been diagnosed with GAD(generalized anxiety disorder) and PTSD to top it off. 

I have a vicious rapid cycle from manic to depressive and stable periods in between which I’ve been able to prolong. As stupid as it sounds, changing my diet(less caffeine/sugar/heavy foods), having a schedule and sleeping more regular has done fucking wonders for my ability to function. 

Everyday is still a damn challenge but I lost my mom to this disorder and I’m not going to let it have me too. I refuse. 

P.S. A hearty salute to everyone still trying to figure out their own medical cocktail that will allow them to deal with this shit maybe just a bit easier... you guys rock. ";1063;44;185;26;19;355;154;255
1486;bipolarreddit;Thelweiss;21/03/2019;"Fighting the stigma against medicating mental illness so people like me don't wait forever to get help Hey there! I'm bipolar and have had a lot of success with lamotrigine, but it took me a really long time to start taking it because there's such an intense stigma around medicating mental illnesses. I kind of assumed I would lose all sense of self if I took them, and I wish I didn't have that feeling for so long (over a decade).

So I started up a project called Wear Your Meds recently to try and help other people not feel that way. Basically it's a series of 1"" buttons, and each button shows a commonly-prescribed mental illness medication. Anyone who wears one of these buttons is signaling that they’re open to sharing their personal story of how the medication helped. It's also a show of solidarity because sometimes it can feel like no one else you know is on meds. I'm hoping some people on here would be into it.

1495;bipolarreddit;TheStarcaller98;19/03/2018;"Massive disagreement between wife Bipolar Type II, OCD, and GAD

I really appreciate anyone that takes the time to weigh in on this.

My wife’s parents did not like me when we first started dating. They were incredibly restrictive and would only let her out to see me once a month. We got tired of that and started sneaking around to see eachother. During that time we had sex, and for LDS culture that is wrong before marriage. Her parents are very strict Mormons, and are the type to judge the hell out of you and spread rumors throughout the church.

Come 5 months after dating, they filed police reports that I was a sexual offender/rapist, and needed to be imprisonment for the protection of their daughter. This paper they wrote up was so detailed i wouldn’t be surprised it was in fucking MLA  format. It was all based on things she had wrote in her journals, which they photocopied as well, and attached to the police report. They then destroyed her phone, threatened not to let her go to church because I was there,  

This went all through the regional church, and suddenly my family and myself were completely ostracized. Incredible restriction went by for the next year and a half. During that time they started using the money in her banking account without her knowledge at all. They didn’t stop until threatened to sue (which under the circumstances I was able to), which they then suddenly had all the money appear again. She was saving for when she turned 18 so we could get her the hell out of there. Which we did.

Once she turned 18 she moved in with me, we severed contact for months with her parents. They stated her sisters weren’t allowed to come to our apartment because they feared I’d rape them. Blocked anyone that supported us from Facebook and any calling/texting, and they went on like nothing happened.

Now she has gone a long time without any support besides myself and my parents. We are still active in our church, but one very far from where this all happened. She doesn’t feel like she has any support from anyone, so she started turning to her parents again. Her mom is incredibly manipulative, and has proven herself to be.

For the last few months she has been trying to essentially convince me that if I just let it go, talk to them, and suddenly be happy about it all again, everything will be better.

I was diagnosed with BPII only two months ago, and before that I had to drop out of my double honors meteorology chemistry major program because my depression ruined my GPA, lost my scholarships, lost my job. Since then I’ve been seeing a therapist twice a month, changed all my Meds around, and got my grades withdrawn and been recovering.

My therapist was appalled to hear this story, and thinks I’m completely justified in not wanting to have anything to do with them. I have told my wife many times, I will talk to them when I’m ready, and forgive them when I’m able to let it go. But after she goes to dinner with them very Sunday, this topic comes up, where I need to forgive them, start going to dinner, and fix all this. The thing is, she wants me to fix it her way and for what she wants. Which under other circumstances would be completely viable, but I hate them. I hate her parents for two years of absolute hell. To this day they have never approached or tried to talk to me in person, haven’t apologized. Nothing. For me, that is the first step, they need to initiate it. Then I will talk. My therapist agrees, and honestly doesn’t think I need to fix this at all right now and thinks I’m completely justified in the way I’m thinking.

Am I over reacting? I don’t know when I’m overreacting with my anxiety, and been in a depressed episode for a year now.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

This took me by complete surprise, since nothing in my life has changed during this time. I have been considering the possibility of a longer hypomanic episode, but I don't what bipolar is like.

I was on Lamictal (350mg/day) for several years, which did wonderful things for me. I also was briefly on lithium, welbutrin, seroquel, trazodone, and propranolol but always found Lamictal to be the most effective. 

Last Spring, my boss decided to lay several people off including myself, which meant I lost my health insurance plan. He didn't honor our Cobra agreement and subsequently my normally $30 refills skyrocketed to $800 per refill. I obviously couldn't afford this and thus went off Lamictal for 9 months. It was horrible, I was suicidal, had raging fits of crying and lashing out at people. I self harmed. I tried to walk onto a freeway. 

My boyfriend has been extremely patient and supportive but doesn't understand what I'm going through. I recently got a healthcare plan again with Kaiser and am now titrating back up (I am on 25mg/day now, going up to 50mg in two days, eventually back to my normal 350). I don't know if it's because I'm older now, or that I stopped drinking, or that I'm also on hormonal birth control (Ortho) this time, but the side effects have been way more intense than I recall when starting last time.

Also things like lack of sleep/drugs/stress often give me extreme paranoia, normally not lasting long (but sometimes months). I was concerned at one point that I might have been part of a government mind control/illuminati thing(and I'm still not completely sure I'm not).

1509;bipolarreddit;throwaway---890;03/04/2018;"Could I have Bipolar? I recently went to a psychologist after an ""intervention"" from my family because I had textbook severe depression for a couple months. The psychologist said I had a lot of red flags for bipolar 1. I was sleeping 14 hours a day and taking NyQuil without my parents knowing to stop suicidal thoughts. I would rather be asleep than deal with thoughts. I was skipping school, practice, and extracurriculars and then failing tests. When I wasn't asleep I was in bed in a dark room just staring at the ceiling. To be all honest though it started before the depression. 6 months ago I was extremely paranoid. I was staying up all hours of the night checking corners and simulating what I would do if someone came into my house to attack me. It got really bad because I was sleep deprived and it devolved from just being paranoid of strangers to my close friends, watching their every move to see if they were out to get me like my thoughts were making me believe. Out of nowhere I started dissociating soon there would be 10 minute chunks of time where my brain would just disappear and I didn't know where it went. After this, I started to get paranoid delusions where I would believe the alien gods that live in a black hole were going to abduct me because I knew about them. I had a panic attack during my lunch period. At this point I had no idea what was going on I thought I was going crazy but because I even had that thought I knew I wasn't. Now this is where things went really downhill. I woke up one day with the best mood I've ever had. When I was at school, everybody thought I was high just because of the way I was acting. I was all spaced out and I talked over everyone.  Nothing I said made any sense. No one really thought anything of it though because everybody assumes I smoke weed because of my personality. I was functioning on 120% with less than 2 hours of sleep per night. All of my inhibitions left me at this stage. I started smoking on school property and also selling weed on school property. This is not something I would ever do because I'm a straight A student and I'm top of my class so this has especially a lot of risk. I was also very close to doing cocaine. This lasted for a week and a half. After all of this I came down really hard, and this is when my depression started as I explained above. I told all of this to my psychologist and she recommended me to see a psychiatrist as soon as possible because my manic like periods are dangerous. The thing is is I don't was to go to a psychiatrist because then it is more real and I might be too young to even get a mood disorder diagnosis. Oh yeah I forgot to mention I'm 15.

1510;bipolarreddit;throwaway89389898;31/03/2018;"In high school I was in a manic episode for 2 years In high school I was in a manic episode. In sophomore year during the hypomanic phase I started talking about sex a lot and got in trouble. Two months into my junior year the mania started. I thought I was going to win the lottery and become the president, the next MLK or really famous. I even intentionally failed classes because I thought I was going to become the president anyway. I thought everyone in America was going to change the constitution for me while I gave a speech in front of a big audience like MLK did in the civil rights march. I thought I had a special connection to god and god put me here for a special purpose.

When I spoke I switched from one topic to another easily. I was very hyper, had lots of energy, was easily distracted and always wanted to chat. One time when I entered school the security guard once said ""this one is always laughing and smiling"". I went with my mom to buy lottery tickets (they don't sell tickets to minors). I thought I was going to win the lottery and use the money to make myself famous. I used to go to an organization with lots of little offices and I had a plan to buy the building and employ people there to promote my agenda. One time a fortune teller solicited me on the street. I went in and I asked her what college I am going to go to. She answered Harvard. I literally thought I was going to Harvard. I didn't tell my parents most of my plans because I thought they would interfere with them. I was very angry and moody at home.

A few days before I turned 18, there was a ""breaking point"" I realized all the stuff I believed weren't true. I was devastated. I wasn't going to become the president or the next MLK. I failed many class. I couldn't sleep at night. I was extremely stressed out. I managed to catch up on my work, took summer school and thankfully graduated in the summer on time. A year later I decided to google bipolar and I read the symptoms  of a manic episode on WebMD.

As I read more about bipolar, I learned it's impossible for bipolar I to go undiagnosed. So I wondered how this went on for 2 years without me being diagnosed? During sophomore year, CPS was called because I was talking about sex. Then at the end of sophomore year I did the most stupidest thing. I drew 9/11 on a state test. This was a math question about storage bins so I made bin laden jokes. I was laughing but the school wasn't and they took me to a hospital. The hospital just let me go and told me not to do this again. The security pointed out a couple of times I was always laughing and smiling. I saw counselors at school (who are mental health professionals). I wondered if this will happen again, but I don't think it will. Well if there's anything worse than bipolar it's severe OCD. I am taking medication for that now. Severe OCD is **HELL**.

I most certainly embarrassed myself. In 9th grade I told my classmates I wanted to become a prostitute. I was annoying during my high school years. I didn't think there was anything wrong with me. I thought there was something wrong with everybody else. I guess I am lucky this happened in high school where you are still supported by your parents and not in adulthood where you quit your job and become homeless. Online I realized was safer than offline. When I posted online I used a pseudonym and never used my identity. So if I said I wanted to become a prostitute or something embarrassing online it would not affect my reputation. But if I say I want to become a prostitute to my friends, they'll remember it and it will affect your reputation. I actually had former classmates come up to me and say ""remember when you said you wanted to become a prostitute"". I mean I am most definitely not the person I was in HS.

We had a teacher with a reputation for being mean and a girl at my school said she's bipolar because one minute she's happy and the next minute she's angry. I literally thought that was the teacher's diagnosis, but I didn't know what bipolar was or that I had it. Now I know what bipolar is, and realize the girl was using the term colloquially.

my very best friend has always been COMPLETELY stable--in fact she's the rock of our friend group. 

she and i always spoke every single day, ever since we were 11. we would write and share poetry; go to movies together; do kitchen gardening together; shop together; ride horses together; watch tv for hours together; even travel together--we've been to portugal, spain, mexico, the bahamas, peru, and canada. 

we are southern and she really is as sweet as pecan pie. 
i love her like a sister.

her 30th birthday was three months ago, december 28. she was NOT herself: speaking rapidly, having ""amazing"" ideas, vastly inflated self-esteem, incredibly project-oriented, overly friendly to everyone, no filter when speaking (lots of sextalk, really a no-no in AL), said she didn't sleep anymore. it was frightening to watch. a doctor friend who was at her birthday party told me quietly he thought she was manic. he was right. 

the past three months has been hell. she has been hospitalized twice. she lost her job and her boyfriend. she is spending all of her money. all she wants to do is go out to honkeytonks and drink, or go out dancing in the nearest city (formerly she had no interest in either activity). my momma was a raging alcoholic and i have terrible anxiety about drinking (and in general), so i simply cannot go out with her. she is being aggressive to strangers when she is out.

she has de-escalated a few times but not to the point of normality (we went to see a romcom and she laughed loudly at every joke, but very artificially, almost inappropriately). i am so scared for her. before her second hospitalization she attacked her boyfriend and her sister (this is why her bf left). she refuses to take her risperdol.

will she ever be ""normal"" again? she is in denial. after her first hospitalization she told me was fine. i am exhausted and run down from the uncertainty of it all and frankly a little afraid of her. i already know we will never travel together again, but will she ever be my poetry-writing, mint-growing bff again? i really struggle to be around drunk/unpredictable people. even her horse seems nervous around her now.

i am desperate to help her but i feel myself pulling away because i can't condone or participate in the drinking/aggression toward strangers. i cannot speak to her honestly about her condition because she doesn't believe she has it. bp1 is NOT!!!!!! a problem for me in our friendship but her choice to drink and not take meds is. i feel my trust vanishing. it is so heartbreaking. her very religious gamma recently told me she feels her granddaughter is dead.

i have read every single thing i could find about bp1 but i'm still confused about outcomes. i have been there for her as much as i can, was right there after the first hospitalization, have taken her out to flower shows, a dressage event, and dinner (even when she's irritable and delusional), but i am just so scared. i am scared of her.

PLEASE help us. what can i do? what can i expect? 

god bless all of you. god bless your families. i hope you all feel good today.";2615;101;453;62;59;844;294;607

1528;bipolarreddit;tigerjack84;18/04/2018;"Hey, I’m new here! I just wanted to ask some questions. Does anyone go through the whole ‘range’ within a few weeks? Ie, a (I presume) brief period of hypo/mania, to the depressive stage, to anxious to eventually ‘normal’ to then swing back round to it all? I’m in denial, and don’t want anything to be wrong. I’ve had from what I remember in the past, two massive depressive periods - the childhood one I can’t remember too much about it. The last one, I was physically ill with it. My mil likes to remind me of how my body was ‘here’ I most definitely was not. Any manic episodes I have managed to keep myself in check, but this is I presume the anxiety’s doing. I have an irrational fear of repercussions, (that and a poor credit rating) and normally contain it to getting new pets or some other thing that is a huge distraction. If I had access to money, I dread to think. 

Drinking, I can go where I literally want to drink ALL the time, to never wanting to touch it, I also get suicidal after drinking (a bit like how you feel after a manic episode, where you just think what a d**k you’ve made of yourself, and the shame over what you’ve done, well, what you remember anyway) 

I still don’t know a lot about this illness, (only recently been referred) I see the mental health team every week, but I kept fobbing them off when bipolar was mentioned ‘I’m not bipolar!’ And for anyone from the UK, we pretty much only have Stacey from eastenders as point of reference *facepalm* . I never act out on suicidal thoughts, (health anxiety there too).

Also, does anyone ‘forget’ a lot? Eg, I literally washed and changed my daughter (she’s 1 1/2) and literally 5 mins after, I couldn’t remember what all I did.. did I change her nappy? Did I wash her? Did I brush her hair (for that one, I can see her hair has been brushed, but I can remember doing it) I forget if I have eaten, went to the toilet. 

Work, I struggle so much. I get anxious over it, I can’t face them when I go back after being off sick. The looks I’m given, the questions as to why I was off and if I’m feeling better (all in good heart) but I get so ashamed I can’t manage. I struggle to get up and ready to go in. When I’m there I struggle with deadlines, and adherence - everything is timed. I accidentally got a new job, in a completely different sector, where I’m looking after people with dementia. How Can I actually look after people when I can barely manage to look after myself? I’m treading water, and poorly. I’ve four kids, (the elder three are teens) and they’ve to help me so much, as my partner. I’m terrified of another massive depressive episode as before as I CANNOT spend another year or more ‘not here’ I struggle talking to doctors about this, so will be glad when I finally meet the clinical psychologist who’s been assigned to me.

Also, cbt, doesn’t seem to work anymore :( i can’t take hold of my thoughts, which in turn make dealing with them impossible..

I was recently diagnosed with unipolar mania/bipolar NOS after having a ton of hypomanic episodes over the past three years (started out as 1-2 a year but over the last six months I've had at least one a month, each lasting up to 10 days).

I just started lithium, so I had my bloodwork pulled, and my TSH showed up with a result of 2.78 mIU/L. My psychiatrist looked at that result and said that we need to get it below 2, and that she thought my high TSH was the reason I was rapid cycling.

1537;bipolarreddit;tiredcollegegirly;12/04/2018;"Advice for me - diagnosed with depression, questioning bipolar This is something I just don’t know how to address.
I have depression and anxiety (diagnosed 2 years ago, but I’ve been aware of it for much longer). I was given 3 medications for my panic attacks and depression by my college’s psychiatrist, but upon her retiring, the college wellness center notified me that a nurse practitioner would be monitoring my medication from them on. I felt unsafe, angry, and wiped from the medication so I stopped taking it. I quit going to appointments, and eventually they billed me for all of my no-shows and never followed up.

For months after I went off my meds, I experienced suicidal thoughts, extreme depressive thoughts, and began self harming. This was very out of character for me. But I stayed off my mess out of fear of regressing. I somewhat leveled out.

I have a family history of bipolar disorder, and I’m getting close to graduating. I’ve been feeling very much unlike myself lately, and I’m (and my boyfriend is) noticing rapid mood changed from manic (cleaning the ENTIRE house, instigating fights, eating constantly which I’m not sure is exactly manic but I can’t regulate it, and rapid thoughts) to depressive (laying in bed and threatening to never get out, crying before every shift at work because I’m just so tired, feeling like I’m making no progress and just feeling small). My boyfriend has told me at times he feels in-equipped talking me through these episodes. He’s expressed that I should consider going to therapy again.

I’m graduating in December, and I just feel like potentially being diagnosed with something else or being recommended new medication can ruin that. I’ve worked so hard to get here and I want my degree. But I feel as though it’s irresponsible to put off taking care of my mental health.

I’m also pretty poor so therapy would be tough for me to pay for. I do have insurance though, so I don’t know how much of a difference that could make. I’ve only ever received free therapy. 

Does anyone have recommendations? Is it worth pursuing a diagnosis for soundness of mind, or is it possible for me to just recognize that in myself and adapt? I limit alcohol intake, as that typically makes things worse for me. But I’m afraid of taking medication because I’m so forgetful and anxious about actually going to refill my prescription.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been struggling to figure out whether or not I have BP, but my complicated past makes me afraid that I may have BPD so I am just going to lay it out and if anyone out there, help me out. 

&amp;#x200B;

To start. There is a stigma surrounding BPD and a part of me admits to being afraid of lying to myself so I don't get labeled as a crazy BPD. My mother was BPD, and my father was a psychologist who diagnosed me as BPD by the time I was twelve, but he also intensely hated my mother. I have always been incredibly emotionally sensitive, but cognitively I was one of those kids who were three levels above everyone in class, and three levels behind on the social scale. I dread seeing a therapist after being raised by my father who became obsessive and emotionally abusive over my being BDP. But bear with me pls.

I think I've had three episodes. My earliest one was when I was thirteen. I remember being overcome with such intense suffering that I collapsed in the shower. It was like I was catatonic. I literally couldn't get up. That night it was as if the world were silent. I remember laying in bed staring at my hands. They kept moving, but I wasn't understanding that I was inside of them. I remember having the intense realization that I was going to watch these hands age, and that I was inside of a living corpse. I was repulsed by that thought and became fascinated with hands for awhile. 

&amp;#x200B;

My second episode happened my first year of college. I'll skip the fluff. One day I just stood up mid class and left. Just dropped out of college. I remember sitting there thinking, what am I doing here? My professor was talking, but I wasn't understanding her words. (I went back to college after a period).

&amp;#x200B;

But what prompted this post was the most recent episode that scared me. I convinced myself that I was losing my mind. I got obsessive over ""sanely questioning my sanity"" and ""being made to make my suffering."" Like my brain just stalled. I was in the middle of a 20 page research paper and I couldn't get my thoughts together to write it. I reread the things I wrote later and realized that I kept repeating the same words over and over. But I was also under an insane amount of stress. I was also convinced that my teachers were correcting my borderline behavior through subliminal therapy (still kind of convinced...?) This ""episode"" lasted for 4 months, but I had decided to quit smoking weed right around the same time. Still, I had been off of weed for awhile when I think I had an audial hallucination. I was on the verge of falling asleep, in that between stage where you're still conscious but your dreams start to engulf you, when this voice in the back of me head detached itself. It took on a presence of its own (idk how to explain) like it floated out of my brain and was talking. It startled me awake. I snapped out of it, but I was really scared for awhile. 

&amp;#x200B;

I won't lie, a part of my has come to terms with being BPD. I have self mutilated, and I have felt suicidal. I get feeling so intense that I don't know how to relieve my emotions so I will drink and push my limits in risky ways. I have issues maintaining relationships (although that has been improving now that I am consciously working on it). I know dual diagnosis is possible, but a part of me seriously worries if I lie to myself so I don't have to face being BPD, living up to the label put on me by an abusive parent. At the same time I am beginning to string together a family history that may suggest psychosis, although no one in my family is open to talking about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you made it to the end, it on me- BPD, BP, BPBPDP. I feel close to myself right now and am looking for answers in my own way. My mental state is getting is affecting my career, and I find myself in a place where people are tiptoeing around me and I can't stand it (but I understand it, and want to start working on fixing it).

1541;bipolarreddit;toasterbell;25/03/2018;"Um, is it me? So, I finally got an appointment with a real psychiatrist two weeks ago and was diagnosed with bipolar (II). However, at the time I couldn't believe how the office was set up.  You walked into a waiting room with two receptionist windows on the other side. The receptionists sat behind frosted glass windows that were closed, and in front of each was one of those bells. There were no signs specifying which window to go to or even saying ""please ring bell for service"".  I must have stood there fidgeting for 3 or 4 minutes before finally knocking on the window lightly (no way was I gonna ring a bell in a quiet office). Then, while I was filling out my paperwork they decided to turn on music and it was the Braveheart soundtrack.  So, I'm sitting there listening to the sountrack to a film where someone gets disembowled and it occurs to me that they can't be THAT stupid and they must have hidden cameras or something to see what their patients do in such an uncomfortable situation. Now, two weeks later I'm like,  ""um, you totally thought someone was watching you on a hidden camera"".

1542;bipolarreddit;Tomanydorks;26/01/2019;"Should I contact BP ex in this situation? (Cross posted from r/bipolar sos.) My BP2 Dumped me last summer in the middle of a mixed episode. Her stated view was that it was because I had made too big a deal out of something to me when she was in a bad space. She left me on the day I had a pretty significant head injury. Because of various medical stuff she had going on at the time, we didn’t really speak much. We had been planning to marry and move together. That didn’t happen. I was completely blindsided by all this. Three months later, I left town for medical treatment. Even though she said she wasn’t going to do this, she completely ghosted me when I left.
My treatment hasn’t really worked. Eight months later now, I am getting closer to being unable to do my work. It looks like I have CTE. I don’t have a whole lot of support in life, in terms of family and other people, and I’m losing my livelihood. My personality has changed. I am not planning to continue my life like this, and I consider it a matter of maintaining some personal dignity in the face of what’s going to be an unpleasant future. Yes, I’ve done everything I can and I’m continuing to try, but I live in the United States, and there’s not a real viable set of alternatives for me. I will probably end my life later this spring or in early summer, when I can wrap up what I need to do to not leave a mess other people have to deal with. This question is not about that decision. I have my dignity, and the prognosis isn’t good.
And I don’t know, because I can’t tell, whether she has ever come out of this phase, or if she’s still in it.
Should I send her a letter and and tell her goodbye? It’s the only unresolved relationship in my life. It would be especially helpful to hear from people with BP. Would you want to hear from me, or would it be better just to find out from other people? She was having a hard time with all relationships at the time, and I don’t believe at least then she hated me. I think she still loved me. I don’t want to do it in such a way that would feel weird and manipulative, I want to give her something tangible that, if she feels anything at all at this point or some point in the future, will let her feel some kind of closure or at least that she wasn’t abandoned.

This subreddit is new to me, I didnt think I was bipolar. 

I had a ""mental health consult"" with my new GP today. He thinks I MIGHT be bipolar. He's prescribed me 25mg Seroquel to take an hour before bed, daily. Only until I get an actual psychiatrist to weigh in on it (appt isnt until june).

I hadn't heard about the drug until today, I've only ever been on citalopram 20mg for depression, it didnt help and made me suicidal.

I dont have problems sleeping. Actually, I told him I sleep too much, if anything. It seems that a lot of people that are prescribed seroquel do. I'm reading all of these horror stories about being crazy high and hallucinations that I've kind of scared myself from taking it.

I dont know if I should be taking it given he doesnt know what my actual diagnosis is. Should I be terribly concerned about the side effects?

1544;bipolarreddit;toobadimnotamermaid;09/02/2018;"Happiness or Anxiety or Hypomania? Hey fellow bipolar people! I have a question...how can you tell if you’re just in a really good mood or if you are going into hypomania? 

The two times I was manic I was having lots and lots of irritability and insomnia and a ton of anxiety. My doctor suggested those were manic episodes based on what I could remember. 

Now, whenever I’m feeling particularly good, I’m constantly worried that I’m not actually happy, but instead, hypomanic. 

For example, I had a good day at work. I got a project done and I got to socialize with my favorite people. Usually work can be a somewhat dramatic place, but those people were out today. I’m home now and I’m feeling good, as in not tired or socially exhausted, which is funny because I’m typically an introvert, but mostly around people I don’t know. 

I also have a tremor....which is usually a sign of anxiety or that I’m really hungry. Big anxiety attacks have resulting in my legs shaking uncontrollably. Can happiness cause anxiety? I don’t feel anxious that often around other people. Maybe I just have low blood sugar? 

I’m on Lamotrigine and Effexor and I take Hydroxyzine at night to sleep, if that makes a difference at all. I’ve been sleeping throughout the night this week, which I think is a good sign.

Any thoughts? I’m going to ask my therapist too next week. ";1071;51;183;36;26;374;141;255

I have such high expectations for myself based based on how well I used to do in school, and I feel like I owe it to my parents to also do well.

1547;bipolarreddit;tori1090;13/02/2018;Possible Misdiagnoses? During the winter of 2016 I was diagnosed with bipolar I, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, PTSD, and a few years earlier ADHD. At first I felt that my diagnoses made sense and I was willing to take my meds. While there were times where I accidentally or deliberately didn't take them, I was mostly consistent. I did in fact feel better in time, though there were many ups and downs. The summer of 2017 I felt that my medications were working amazingly. I was productive, holding a job, writing a book, and overall happy. Beginning my first year of college even started off well. Towards the winter I became very overwhelmed but everyone was due to finals. I expected when our winter break came I would calm down. Throughout the break I had very low energy and a few major mood swings. I convinced my boyfriend to go on a road trip to California with me in the span of a few hours. I felt very excited and couldn't stop talking and laughing. Once we got there I was back to feeling depressed and unhappy, even more so because I thought going on a trip would help me feel better. I thought maybe the cold weather was what had me down, but the change to warm weather made no difference. When we got back in early January I took it upon myself to go off my meds cold turkey (which I know is not the best thing to do and I don't want to suggest that to anyone else). I expected my symptoms to worsen from withdrawals but nothing really happened. I was slightly more emotional and less zombie like, but nothing major. Since then I've only been taking Mydayis for ADHD and I've felt a lot better than I have in the past five months. I've had relatively normal moods, getting sad when something saddening happens or vice versa. This leaves me extremely confused. Is it possible that I don't have the things I was diagnosed with? Or could my symptoms just be taking a break? I had extreme mood swings at the time of my diagnoses and even in the summer briefly. I really just want to know if anyone else has experienced this or has any thoughts.;1649;70;290;35;31;535;203;390

After fiiiinally finding the right med combination about two years ago, I'm finally getting my shit together, getting things done, and living the kind of ""normal"" life I've always wanted. For the first time ever, I'm really proud of myself. I usually just lurk on Facebook, but I felt the need to do a little bragging and let people know that my life is changing, and I'm happy about it. Like most people, my Facebook friends list is an assortment of old classmates, former coworkers, family, and some randoms I can't quite place. A handful of these are people I speak to in real life on a regular basis. I got ZERO replies or feedback from anyone. I'm a little hurt and annoyed - c'mon, guys, I give you courtesy likes for pictures of your average kids and stupid dogs - but not too terribly surprised. 99% of these people only ever knew me when I was un-/improperly medicated and a total fucking mess. It's kind of a relief, though, too, because now I no longer feel obligated hand out those courtesy likes for dumb fucking shit that I don't care about. I already knew, on an intellectual level, that these people aren't really my friends (at least not anymore) and give as much of a shit about me as I do about them (so, none), but I feel like now that I've ""confirmed"" that, I can just relax and go about my business. I'm still proud of myself for what I've accomplished so far, and not having that recognized on social media doesn't change that. I guess it's just hard knowing that no matter how much positive change I make in my life, the people who only ever saw the old me will never really SEE the new me.

I know I struggle with depression, and have all my life. After I got my diagnosis, I got really up up up and dyed my hair pink- and went out drinking a lot. Is that mania? Or just me?

Which makes me feel weird. I feel like I don't know who to believe. My psych definitely thinks I have bipolar. My S/O also thinks I have it. However some friends I have told say that I am fine.

       I am currently on 125mg Lamictal when i wake up then 40mg Geodon before bed.

 I have gone from 240lbs (lithium as mood stabilizer) to instead 215lbs on lamictal (mood stabilizer). So, in trying to get back to the weight I was before medication, 180lbs, I will experiment if Indica Cannibis can produce similar, or better, sleep effects as Geodon. 

If anyone has tried or is in a state where they can try please comment.

My guess is a couple hits off a indica was vape pen and a small edible and you will be counting sheep within an hour. 

Keep in mind I will be continuing on the Lamictal mood stabilizer (studied to cause weight loss) and only seek to eliminate/lessen my dosage of Geodon (said to have low risk of weight gain, which for me is 45 pounds). 


Thanks for reading

Also, I have tried up too 200 mg of CBD oil which was advertised as a alternative for anti psychotics with no success. When i took them in place of the Geodon I would only nap for a few hours in what felt like a shallow, half awake sleep. I would not recommend spending 80 dollars on a 30, 30mg capsules from Wildflower CBD.com (which was recommended by high times so i assume it is legit) they simply do not help you stay asleep. 

I would try the indica strain canabis for myself but live in a state that is dragging their heels with there medical Marijuana program.

1564;bipolarreddit;Turtlphant;02/01/2019;"Addictions and how the heck to quit A little background about myself. My name is Michael. I am 28 years old and live in the USA. I have been diagnosed with bipolar for 8 months but lord knows ive been bipolar all my life. I have 2 addictions, they are video games and weed. They basically run my life. I have friends who do them but they aren't addicted, they're functioning adults even though they smoke and/or play video games. Some thoughts on this; What is the cycle of addiction and bipolar? Maybe it is that at some point in the cycle, you need help mentally, like anything to feel good because you're in the depressive part of the cycle, or maybe you're in the manic part and HAVE to do something ""cool"" and ""fun"" so either way you go to your addiction, your life force, what keeps you here. Then because of this and through this, you're addicted to something.

&amp;#x200B;

But like, so what? I'm just speaking out loud here, but I love my addictions. I don't want to quit them. I play league of legends, and smoke weed. I love doing it. Am I really happy while doing those two things? Deep down, I know the answer is ""not really"", BUT AT LEAST I am not drowning in despair. My addictions keep me from going over the deep end, they are what make life ""okay"". Isn't it acceptable to use these things for my own benefit? 

&amp;#x200B;

However this brings me to my next thought. Do I over-use them? I play league for like, 7 hours a day on average. I smoke CONSTANTLY. I'm high right now as I type this. At work. Was late because I woke and toked, played League for 2 hours, THEN came to work. My boss isn't happy with me. My addictions are a hindrance to my life, as you can see. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are video games and weed ruining my life? Probably. Will I regret it someday? I already do, and will probably continue to further regret they're use as I get older. But they're also saving me.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore I, like any other addict out there, don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I decide to quit.

1. Will life be bleak and dull or will it refill itself with other things? 

2. Will I just find a new addiction? I heard it's impossible to ""quit"" addictions, one has to REPLACE addictions. 

3. When I am drowning in bipolar, which is often, what do I use as a crutch instead of my addictions. I use video and games to ESCAPE! I escape from reality all the time because it is so vicious for me because I am bipolar. I see the world as hell, everything is horrible because I am depressed. When I am in this place, and I need to run away and can't use my addictions anymore, what do I do? That is the time when I would relapse, not knowing what to do but needing something to help me escape my problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. What about quitting addictions would improve my life?

I look at this as a cost/benefit ratio question. Simply put; is the cost of quitting my addictions worth all the work it will be?

1565;bipolarreddit;Tu-whenua-a-Kura;25/03/2018;Advice: The Dead Sea, saltiest place on Earth, second to her. New Relationship, and best described as dating a pretzel... Twisted, salty and I can't get enough! I'm a 22 y/o Maori male and have been seeing this choice as lady for a coupley months, she's 30 and deals with type 1. We just started living together, and she has 2 awesome young girls, who also seem to posses the ability of growing horns on command. I don't know how to explain, that I enjoy playing with fire aware of getting burned. The unpredictable is such a turn on, from good vibes present to more energy than a lightning storm. I haven't known her personally for long, but majority of her previous relationships with family and partners has been a path of hardship through physical, mental and spiritual violence... Due to their lack of understanding/empathy. I'm fortunate to have personal stability, and have so much stength to support this beautiful lady, plenty of time for her daughters, as want to provide them with the guidance and opportunities that, I took for granted in whatever they wish to pursue. It's still early days, and she's a really independent lady, a survivor not a victim, so there aren't labels yet as such, as she struggles with romantic feelings as much as guys. She doesn't take meds, but from previous experience, they bring about a numbness. I strongly identify with spirit/natrual alternatives (as a Maori, not just crazy) if anyone has any suggestions? At times she goes really queit, and you can feel the static in the room, I just haven't grasped, how to bring her out of this headspace, as she is so independent and hasn't had a partner that can support and just listen, without anger or wanting to fix everything she keeps quiet. Her thought manifests in the environment and is like static electricity. she seems to resolve issues like a male through self reflection, rather than a verbal release. Laughter seems to help, so I try change her pattern of thought with humour, but the downside being i dont know what's appropriate at times. Last thing I want is to come across as her mother, especially since early days but I'm all about the family values and just here for support. To listen rather than reply, these ears aren't painted on. If anyone has any advise on this situation, dealing with my lady who could make even the devil breakdown on Jeremy Kyle. Would be much appreciated. She's so worth it, without darkness we'd never appreciate how good the light is. Nothing worse than a basic b*tch, like a challenge.;2016;88;338;44;29;651;256;462

Some stuff happened today and I really need an outlet right now or someone to talk to without judgement... 

My situation is as follows, I’m a guy 18 years old have been struggling with bipolar for years where the hospital seems to be my second home.. recently out of an abusive relationship where I impulsively chose to pick up and leave my home, my family and my everything all of a sudden to move in with my ex 1000 kilometres away with her parents... that’s the extent of how my mania gets along with episodes of psychosis.


Recently I’ve been looking for work and I found what I thought would be a great job at a health food store, I aced the interview and trial then came the first day...

I went in full of smiles and just my best to be positive as I’ve been in a big low lately then all of a sudden I get there and I’m handed the most ridiculous jobs  and well all they would do is put me down and make me feel like I’m absolute f*ckin trash. Now I don’t know if it’s because of my arm which they all saw (covered in scars) or if it was because I chose to not go to college (year 11 and 12) when they’re all university graduates or students.. I don’t know but they were horrible and I was pretty much in tears for my whole lunch break.. I’m a fragile bloke when I’m going threw a low is all I can say.. 

Anyways I got home having a huge anxiety attack so stressed I could feel my impulsiveness and psychotic symptoms coming out.. so I sat down, chain smoked till I couldn’t breathe and sent my boss an email full of excuses trying to make myself sound normal about quitting after 1 day..  I had to quit I really did if I had thrown myself into that job it would of sent me right back to my lowest low..  the thing is while I got the job I was experiencing a manic episode where I talked myself up Beyond imagninable and asked for 40+ hours a week knowing I couldn’t handle it but that’s just the kind of stuff I do...


So that’s my little rant of today’s horrible events :/ if you were able to actually read it all then well thank you and send me a message if you wanna chat.. I feel extremely guilty right now but any support I can get would really help..

1577;bipolarreddit;uhohuhohuhohuhohuh;07/01/2018;"Low grade hypomania is back...and I love it Before my GP put me on antidepressants and spiraled me into a year long crazy cycling that had me re diagnosed to BP I, my mania was a manageable, predictable state that had me making lists of frugality, cleaning like crazy, working out and eating healthy. 

I enjoyed the time, and the depression that followed was usually low-grade as well--general irritability and annoyance of friends, feeling like I no longer loved my boyfriend (which in stability, I found out I don't)

Over that last few months I have finally become stable. Until recently. My medicine has been spotty and once I felt the mania coming I stopped taking it at all.

Back on meds but still manic. I love the feeling. It isn't the crazy ""god is speaking to"" staying up all night redesigning a fish tank (why?) or hyper reorganizing that left my house a total disaster as I couldn't have the focus to follow through.

It's back to setting goals, making lists, focusing on healthy and happiness. Low-grade mania actually makes me SAVE money--I become obsessed with spending as little as I can (whereas the mania from antidepressants had me blow 20k over 4 months)

I feel like I'm enjoying living again. Stability is so... so boring. And the problem with stability is that I never learned self-discipline in the face of not having manic inspirations. It isn't depression, but my room becomes a complete mess, I don't take my dogs on walks, I don't try at work. Again, that's simply because I am so USED to feeling inspiration and energy from mania, that stability requires discipline and vigilance that I have never had to learn.

So why should I go back on meds? To me, this is worth the depression. I become ultra-functional. Functional enough that I can ride out the depressions as people become used to and aware of my energy and motivation. I understand the mania from before, the mania that had me re diagnosed as Bipolar I--that was purely induced from meds-- is unsustainable. I didn't even enjoy it. But this is something altogether different. It is ME. I don't know 'stability', that is not me. I don't even dislike it as I'm going through it, but now that I'm experiencing the energy again I don't think I can go back. 

How am I supposed to write poetry, paint, play the piano, clean, focus on my healthy--how am I supposed to do that stable when I have no knowledge of self-discipline that makes you drudge through you chores while you're tired and uninspired.

I almost feel bad for 'stable' people--to never experience the inspiration that we have. On the other hand, comparing stability to this makes it a no-brainer that this is better. Even the depression was apart of me before. Stability is a whole different person, someone that I don't particularly like.";2206;93;377;55;36;737;227;516

The last time was at Fairfax Behavioral Hospital in Kirkland, WA and it was abusive as hell. Everything about why I was there was horribly exaggerated, and they lied about me when I went to court so I got legally committed to two weeks unless a doctor signed me out. They literally said because I took so long with the strip search (because I’ve been raped quite a few times but you know, they didn’t mention that part), that I couldn’t handle interacting with anyone right now and I was still obviously in an extreme crisis and I might injure someone else. I wasn’t even in an episode lmao, I was fine after two days of being there, and I’ve never been a violent person? But go off I guess. A lot of other shitty things happened and they got my hopes up and said I could leave one day, but then they were like “nah you’re gonna stay for another few days for no reason” I told them it’s illegal to hold me when I’m not in a crisis and they were like “haha ok try to leave then”. When it was my day to leave, my case worker “lost” necessary paperwork and then went on a two hour lunch and my psychiatrist “didn’t have time to write my prescriptions”. I ended up leaving the facility at 7pm when my exit time was 2:30pm.

Not trying to bring up bad memories, but I’m curious to know if it’s more common to have extremely negative experiences rather than positive ones.

So, does anyone have any super shitty inpatient experiences?

To cut a very long story short, I believe I am bipolar, but have been misdiagnosed with borderline personality disorder.  My GP says this is likely, and that my treatment so far has been inappropriate because the crisis team are dismissive of people with personality disorders.  So, she has referred me to see the entry-level people who gauge whether I can see a psychiatrist, with a view to be re-diagnosed.  

After that, I am worried about what will happen.  I desperately want some treatment that will work for me, but I've found that BPD is a very ""sticky"" label and professionals often treat me like I am playing the system to try and get sympathy and as if what I say is unreliable.

I eat pretty good and try to get outside as much as I can even though I'm a shut in, agoraphobic. I go to therapy. My problems are dealt with, my stressors are at a minimum.

Why the fuck am I depressed? Why the fuck can't I sleep? Seriously, it's almost 8am and now my schedule is completely out the window. I'm not even hypomanic, I don't have any energy. I've been laying here watching YouTube, eating left over pizza, just kind of doing nothing. I'm so pissed.

The worst part is, there's a cycle! An actual, honest to god cycle. Not just a bipolar cycle where triggers set things off. No no no. This is a biological cycle. You see, I have PCOS. And every time I've gotten my period since I was 9 years old, it's made me depressed, moody, bitchy, argumentative, etc. A lot of the time, I start to think this is all from my hormones and I don't even have bipolar. I'd be even more convinced if my lithium didn't work great within 2 days of my first time taking it, and it didn't run rampant in my family. Alas, I have the family curse.

But seriously, having PCOS is a fucking curse, too. I use the app Clue to track my cycle and I just checked it tonight to see where I'm at and realized why I was being such a cunt to my fiance all weekend and never wanted to leave the apartment. Why I keep falling asleep later and later in the morning everyday and can't get out of bed until the late afternoon. I'm fucking 25 years old! This is so stupid. I haven't been able to have a job in years because of this and I've never gotten any kind of relief from any doctor.

Those fake sun lamps don't help. Melatonin doesn't do shit. Sleeping pills make me hallucinate. I've been checked for any type of vitamin deficiencies. I try to fix my schedule at least once a month, where I won't sleep for like 30 hours. It's ridiculous, it's the same shit all year every year.

I'm so sorry if this isn't really a bipolar post, I think it is because I feel like my cycle effects my bipolar so much that this happens every month. But I could be wrong, maybe it's just all the hormones and my bipolar is completely fine.

I have bipolar 2 and anxiety, I’ve been pretty much stable with little dips into mild depression for awhile. I was only taking gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. Gabapentin was the first mood stabilizer I ever tried, and it’s always kept my hypomania at bay and my anxiety dialed down a little. Hydroxyzine comes in for sleep and breakthrough anxiety. It works. I’m productive and mostly good. But the little dips into mild depression started to string together and I feared I might go into a deep depressive episode so I just told my doctor I want to add an SSRI. We’re trying Celexa right now. 

So I took it last night (she said some people prefer night, some morning) for the first time and couldn’t sleep very well. So I’m definitely going to switch to the morning from now on. I had a little stomach upset but not too bad. 

I slept less than I need to but I feel really good this morning. I’m still on my gabapentin and Hydroxyzine. And will go back to take just the hydroxyzines at night so I go back to sleeping normally. 

BUT, I don’t know if it’s too soon to tell, obviously it’s been like 12 hours, but this morning I got up feeling really optimistic and happy to start my day. Maybe this is placebo effect (although I’m usually skeptical that things will work) or maybe I’m just super lucky with things working on the first try. 

I don’t know. Just letting y’all know that I’m feeling optimistic and happy. I felt pretty good before, but let my doctor know even though I was stable, I was still struggling a little with depression and I’m hopefully this addition works out. ";1353;48;246;30;28;440;165;326

In inpatient they just said I needed to find god and quit smoking pot and life would be dandy. Then, the inpatient program took me off my depression and ADHD meds because I traded adderall for a cigarette. Life was miserable.

So, I went straight to university after inpatient treatment (genius move) and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I think that the diagnosis is fitting but I don’t trust it completely; what if it’s BPD or Cyclothymia? 

Fast forward a year, I dropped my therapist. School is tough because I’m either so hyped up I think that I don’t need school because I’m a genius and a god among men and can do anything I want with my life.

I don’t want to lose my sex drive or get fat or be lazy.  I don’t want to give up drugs and alcohol. And I’m really distrustful of doctors because not a one has helped me in the past.

I'm a high school student who was a month ago diagnosed with Bipolar II. I'd been having depressive episodes for about a year, and a month and a half ago started experiencing manic episodes as well, which was the reason why I decided to see a doctor. I'm still very early in my treatment, don't yet have a psychiatrist and won't for another month or two (thanks, American health insurance) and I've been having a really hard time coping. I've always been a very high achieving student, getting straight A's every semester, and doing my best not to miss school. This year, however, has been different. Due to my Bipolar Disorder, I've now missed a month of school, have had to drop 3 classes, and I really don't know what to do at this point. My mental health takes top priority, so I am certainly not planning on sacrificing my health and safety for school. I'm feeling really hopeless and lost, and balancing school, work, and my illness just isn't possible anymore. I plan on going to college next year, but I'm afraid that my absences and now failing grades are going to affect my ability to get scholarships. I really just need to take this year off without ""dropping-out"", so I can get the help I need. I was wondering if anyone here has any advice or similar experiences.

Mania made me miss my class,
Perhaps that's why I didn't pass.
Mania made me steal those tools,
Played the clown and class fool.

Mania made me smash the school window, 
Lobbed it hard, smashed in one throw.
Mania made me drink so hard,
Smashed the gin glass left the shards.

Mania made me smash a door,
I wept and wrangled on the floor.
Mania made me drink too much,
Persuaded myself it was my crutch.

Mania made me incredibly poor,
Living life became a chore.
Mania made me feel as such,
That one day the stars I could touch.

Mania made me think I was God,
But then I behaved like such a sod.
Mania made me talk so loud,
But perhaps I shouldn't be so proud.

Mania made me rather odd,
I told the others who'd wryly nod.
Mania makes my mind a crowd,
I try to calm it with a shroud.

Mania gave me a wild sex binge,
But surely after I did cringe.
Mania made me accuse my friend,
I thought he stalked me hours on end.

Mania made me search the garden,
Made me accuse you - I beg your pardon.
Mania made me stop my pills,
Suspect the government of grave ills.

Mania made me think I was Marx,
Made a speech in the park, commandeered a high street march.
Mania made me see weird shapes,
Talk nonstop two hours straight.

Now I'm in a mental hospital, the loony bin, the madhouse. Now I am deep in the shit because mania made me do it. Mania made me do it!

They're always there but I'm always too exhausted to do anything, and love the people in my life way too much. EXCEPT for when I'm manic. Manic lows or highs give me so much energy and that tends to worry myself and my boyfriend. The only time I really consider hurting myself is when I am manic. Often needing my boyfriend to stop me.

I'm going to Europe in June and want to work with my boyfriend to create a safety plan for when I'm feeling like this. One of those ""when I'm feeling like this, I'll do this. If that doesn't work I'll do this."" This isn't just for suicidal ideations, but also other side effects to the mania.

A big part of the reason I want to do this with my boyfriend is that he is far more concerned than I am that I'll do something I would regret doing or hurt myself. Biggest two concerns are me cheating on him or me hurting myself. Mostly this is to put his mind at ease when I'm away. He worries about me so much when I am here, never mind my two months away from him.

Quick background: BP1, Lamictal, Welbutrin, Benztropine, Hydroxyzine.

So, I have a appointment with my pdoc this afternoon.... and I really feel like I need a med change of some sort. Long story sort I went inpatient last year around July for a full blown psychotic manic episode after taking SSRIs for months and not realizing they were in fact driving me bat shit crazy. They kept me in the hospital for 16 days on a CEC, which I think I'd the max without a court order. I went ""home"" slightly less delusional than when I went in, still not well by any means. This subsided as time passed and with med compliance. As I came down I was in a mixed state for a while and eventually wound up crashing into what I was hoping was only a depressed episode, the only thing is that I have not come out of it for almost a year now. Furthermore at this point it doesn't feel like my depressive lows of the past. I feel more detached from life than ever and I am constantly, obsessively  plagued by the thought that somehow I will stumble upon some kind of joy that I once understood. I have lost any and all drive that I once had..... Personal Improvement, Professional Advancement, Sexual Intamacy, Intamacy of any kind for that matter, it has all been lost somewhere in the past. It feels like when you misplace your keys  and need to get out of the house quickly because you are already running behind for an ""important"" event.  Every minute that passes while you look for the keys you know you are falling further and further behind and then you start to regret not making an intentional effort to put them where they could be found after you last used them.... but as they say hindsight is 20/20.  Finally you look up and realize that even if you did find you keys at this point that you likely wouldn't make it until after the events concludes anyway, so what's the point in stressing over it now, worry about it tomorrow...... Rinse and Repeat. My life has become a series of repetitive movements, each step trying to make it to the next hoping it will be easier, but it's not. Each night trying to fall asleep and telling myself that I will wake up rested an refreshed to take on the day, but I won't. I don't want sympathy, I don't want attention, I just want to feel better, I truly just want to be well. Whatever the hell that means.

I need possible opinions Between the ages of 12-13 I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder after a short stay in a mental hospital. This mental hospital stay was right after the start of my first period. Over the years that I was medicated I took Lamictal, Prozac, Buproprian, and Lithium. They didn't do much except harm my memory and turn my into a zombie. However, I never had many of the Bipolar symptoms to begin with. Just mood swings and a lot of PTSD related trauma behaviors. At the age of 18 I took myself off of them and almost three years later I have still not had a manic episode. However, in the past few months I have noticed a pattern where my depression, negative thoughts, and unstoppable crying (among other things) come about a week before my period and disappear almost as soon as my period arrives. I am not sure if this is important but, my mom who was given a Bipolar diagnosis that was later retracted also experienced similar pre-period symptoms. I would like to be treated for my possible PMDD however my psychiatrist is worried that potentially treating my PMDD with Prozac could reactivate any latent Bipolar Disorder. I was just wondering how often Bipolar and PMDD are misdiagnosed as one or the other and if you guys ever were misdiagnosed? How did treatment go for you? What do you use to treat your PMDD? What is your opinion on this matter as well? I don't have a lot of friends who understand this kind of thing and I want an outside opinion before I start something potentially damaging.;1263;61;194;40;19;425;161;284
1619;bipolarreddit;wanttoquityesterday;04/04/2018;"Actually losing my mind + new meds **Trigger Warning:** Talk of suicide. Sorry I can't edit the title. 

Bipolar II here with several anxiety disorders and PPD/PPA for funzies. 

I've been actively suicidal (but not attempting) and somewhat paranoid lately. The only reason I don't kill myself is because of my 10-month-old son and a volunteer project I don't want to leave unfinished. 

I should add that I am traditionally very high functioning -- successful career, marriage, healthy baby -- but life circumstances have taken a flamethrower to my world and burned it down to ashes as of late. On a scale of 1-10, my level of stress is at a 13.

I came into my psychiatrist's office sobbing Tuesday morning. I didn't tell her everything, but I told her as much as I could without her being legally obligated to commit me. My doctor doubled my Lamictal dose, added Seroquel for sleep (because I was worried about developing a physical dependency on Klonopin), and added Gabapentin as a spot treatment for anxiety. 

Last night I took the Seroquel as directed. I woke up this morning and my first thoughts upon waking were that I wanted to kill myself and that I was half hoping that my baby had died in his sleep (in some way that wasn't my fault) so that I could be free of the responsibility of being a mother. I'm sure if I walked into his room and he was actually dead, I would lose my goddamn fucking mind. It would be the literal end of me. I have really intense OCD about his safety and intense fears around him dying as a younger infant used to keep me from sleeping. So that was a super strange and disturbing mismatch of thoughts.

With that great start to the day, I quickly downed the double dose of Lamictal, as directed, and tried to get on with things. I walked back in the kitchen to my breakfast and half of it was gone and I had no recollection of eating it. I walked around the house for awhile wondering if I had put the pastry down for a minute and forgotten about it. Nope. I did not find the pastry in another room. 

Almost the exact same thing happened yesterday with a donut. I ate half of a donut on the way to the doctor's office. I thought I had a whole second donut in my bag. When I looked in my bag after the appointment, there was only half of a donut left. I thought maybe a homeless person in the grocery store ate half of it and put it back in the pastry case and I didn't notice when I purchased it (it was a sketchy grocery store; it could happen, though unlikely). I told myself that was insane and that surely I ate half of the second donut and forgot about it. I tried to tell myself I was being nuts and eat the rest of the damn donut, but I ended up spitting it out because I pictured another person's mouth on it. 

Can stress really cause memory problems like this or am I straight up losing it? Why the fuck do I keep having memory problems only around my breakfast? I am not eating very much at all, so maybe it's first thing in the morning blood sugar thing.

Around noon, with the new drugs in my system, instead of wanting to kill myself, I just don't see the point of anything. I had a job interview today that went fine. But all professional jobs just seem stupid to me all of a sudden -- like we are all working on gibberish and acting like it matters. Who the hell cares if we make a new brochure and more people buy a product? I feel like a 15-year-old who just watched Fight Club for the first time and realized capitalism is meaningless. 

I had some other projects I was working on, and I just don't understand the point now. Why would I spend time refinishing a dresser? Seriously, why? I can't think of anything more stupid.

I also had the thought this morning that I feel like I'm on life support but instead of a breathing machine, it's a bunch of pills.

Right now I'm thinking about leaving everything right where it is, telling my husband he needs to pickup the kid from daycare tonight, and just bailing and going to another country until my money runs out. That would fuck up my life and relationships irreversibly. So I might as well kill myself if I'm going that route. Or not. No idea. 

I guess I wanted to write because 

1) I would never, ever admit this stuff in real life because it makes me sound like a horrible person who hates my baby and I would never tell another living soul how bad off I really am. 

2) can Seroquel make me even more insane? Because that's how I feel. I'm thinking maybe I should just up the Lamictal and see what that does before proceeding with the onslaught of new drugs.

**Edited to add:** I am following doctor's orders on the meds. My doctor suggested adding new ones and upping the existing one. I just worry that they are going to make things worse while we sort out the cocktail and I may not have the capacity for things to get worse right now.";3813;147;712;62;74;1240;389;936

I'll need to buy out fuel, pay for utilities &amp; cable 'installation' (even tho I have my own modem), and my first mortgage payment is 18 days after closing. It feels tiring.

Like, I'm not stressed about the house. At all. My mother is. She picks at it like, 'I don't think you're going to like the commute' 'Are you picking out the shingles for the roof? No? That's a mistake.' 'You can't put a roof on in winter.' And she was stressed about it *for me* in the beginning because she thought it was a 2 bedroom house *even though I sent her the listing that showed it was a 3 bedroom*. And she was stressing ME out, where I had all my shit in order.

I've had all my shit in order so much that I haven't had to gather paperwork or do anything for the past 3 and a half weeks. I've been twiddling my thumbs, just *waiting*.

And I texted a couple people from game night, who haven't texted me back. And I'm stressed about it. And I'm worried they all collectively decided I was crazy and to stop talking to me because that's what I tell myself when I'm depressed - that I'm useless and a burden and everyone would be better off without me.

Even my friend who I was supposed to babysit for on Saturday hasn't gotten back to me. I feel so alone, and I feel like I'm doing it to myself. Because I am.

 

Edit: Heard back from one friend. Still on for babysitting at least. She's awesome. People don't hate me.

Very motivated, productive, going to sleep early and waking up early, etc. I think it slowly ramped up to the point where I was out of the house doing school work or going to the gym or eating out or working like 16 hours a day, making big plans, etc. Everything seemed really beautiful, and i think around that point I started to realize I was manic. Then, this past week or two I’ve begun drinking and smoking every night, if I’m sober I feel like buzzing out of my skin. I’ve been hungover for days and I think I’m acrually getting the flu now. The thing is, I don’t exactly feel “manic” anymore, but I don’t feel depressed either. I’m not out being productive like I was at the beginnings of the episode, I generally feel more on edge and tense? Like instead of having a bunch of positive energy, i have more intense or stressed energy? I can’t eat more than a few bites of anything with out getting nauseas, even if I smoke and get the munchies. I’m eating maybe like 500 calories a day, not including alcohol. I can’t sleep unless I smoke. The other day I worked 8 hours, went out drinking all night, slept for 4 hours and then went back and worked an 8 hour shift. I took a test still drunk from the night before and got a 92%. Im going to the gym every other day just because I like the communal energy. 

I don’t really know what I’m getting at here. I guess I just feel sick as fuck from drinking all week and barely eating. But despite feeling sick I still feel like going out and being social. But I don’t feel all positive and motivated like I did at the beginning? Idk what’s going on.";1349;41;277;23;27;457;162;354

1628;bipolarreddit;wenca7590;04/04/2019;"I was recently diagnosed with bipolar and it's making me question my own identity I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder three weeks ago. I am going through a major depressive episode and went to see a psychologist my mother recommended. My anxiety is slowly killing me and forcing everyone that I care about away from me. The meds aren't doing their job and I'm just really looking for some support and reassurance that I'm not all alone and absolutely insane.

I prided myself in my abilities in the arts and my motivation and commitment when school started, and always attributed my falling grades to the lack of motivation as the year dragged on. After being diagnosed I'm just not sure exactly of who I am anymore. I'm afraid people are going to look at all my past, recent, and future achievements with ""oh its due to mania"", but I feel like I need that validation to keep doing what I do. It has always been a way for me to express myself.

My mom and grandma also have bipolar. My mom is extremely unstable and controlling, and the only thing holding her back from completely grabbing my skin and stepping into it herself is the fact that I wasn't bipolar like her. Now that I am, she has been forcing her past feelings of when she was young onto me. She's pushing onto me her experiences, trying to relive her life through me, and its making me question my own identity and whether or not I'll just end up like this nightmare that is my mother. 

My mother is also only taking me to her psychiatrist and doctors. I should trust them, as they are reputable institutions in the area, but I don't because of their affiliation with my mother. She is the only person I know who has this, so I decided to make an account and find some people to help me go through this process.";1428;66;243;32;19;479;172;339
1629;bipolarreddit;WestonParish;10/01/2018;"finally got up the courage to go to the Psychiatrist. I'd been hesitant.. scared.. wary.. about going before. Thoughts racing through my head of what a diagnosis would mean for me. My pdoc didn't feel comfortable giving me a diagnosis for anything other than general anxiety/depression, and recommended I go to a specialist so I could get more accurate treatment. Took me well over a year to finally go. I'd made appointments and blew them off , never actually going. I'm so glad I did now.


I had to get over the fact that I would get diagnosed with 'something' and it would be on my medical records. I guess I had some preconceived notion that it would never go away and there would be some sort of stigma attached to me everywhere I go. Irrational as that may sound, it is what prevented me from seeking professional help.


I finally went this past Monday, spent an hour with a P.A. talking about my history, what meds I am currently on (Lexapro/Wellbutrin from my pdoc), etc. She took that information and talked to one of their head Psychiatrists about it, then came back about 15 minutes later with him. He was very nice, understanding, and seemed genuinely interested and concerned about my care. My personal research proved to be right. I have Bipolar II. I felt an inner sense of calmness and clarity now that I had a professional, someone that has spent their life studying conditions such as this, verifying that yes indeed, there was something amiss in my brain. And that better help was coming.


Lexapro had been working WONDERS for my anxiety and slightly for depression as well. Wellbutrin didn't seem to do much, but made life ""liveable"". I was not thriving or excited about anything. Just going through the motions.


He took me off Wellbutrin and replaced it with a mood stabilizer, Trileptal. I stopped the Wellbutrin cold turkey and started Trileptal that same night. I had a really good Tuesday and today is looking great as well. 


I feel much better now that I was finally able to get over myself and get proper help, and hopefully better meds to balance my moods. I have a follow up appointment in 2 weeks. By then I hope to see even more positive changes with the Trileptal.


I also chose to stop drinking cold turkey as well. I knew I had been drinking too much for too long. Each time I drank it was 6+ beers, and sometimes 4-5 nights a week. It became routine. A way to quell my mind at the end of the night. To slow the racing thoughts. It took the words from the Psychiatrist to really cement it in my brain that alcohol counteracts anti depressants and that in order to feel better, I would need to make a lifestyle change. He said the Trileptal would assist in those nighttime racing thoughts.


I even stopped smoking cannabis. This happened after I started the Wellbutrin. I think that can be attributed to the fact that Wellbutrin is somewhat of a cessation tool used for people quitting cigarettes. The urge or desire to smoke (which used to be daily) just stopped. I don't care anymore. It doesn't really do anything for me. Even with my MMJ card and specific strains, all it really did was numb me and slow my brain down (again like with Alcohol to slow the racing thoughts). So without the alcohol and cannabis, I feel strongly that I can finally let my mind be a blank slate for the psych meds to work properly and not be counteracted or made less effective by other psychoactive chemicals.


I am committed to feeling better, and if drinking La Croix instead of beer helps in any way, I'm all for it. I want to be able to let the meds do their job in the most effective manner.


Thanks for being here, community. I may not post much but do lurk frequently and have gleaned a ton of helpful insights over time since I have been subbed.


I hope you all have a wonderful day!";3019;138;536;68;52;954;320;703
1630;bipolarreddit;What_u_callme;09/01/2018;"I think the police are coming Last night I took my normal medication and vitamins for Bipolar I. Then I started the shower on 100% hot. I pulled out. Few other medications - just 2ish doses - and took them. I just wanted to see what it could feel like. I showered nice and hot (I'm a girl so the fires of hell would be comfortable lol), then laid down and listens to my playlist. The steamy bathroom and songs I love felt good.

My husband woke up at 1am to use the restroom and asked me' ""what the hell are you doing?"" Then moved on. I have been hiding this for so long. Thinking and planning and trying to figure things out. On my way to work he told me to drop my attitude and I lost it and told him everything. Everything I've kept secret for 9 months. I told him my final plan and what I'd done.

He told me to go home or he'd call the police to my work. So I kept on going to work. He's not my master. But I don't want them to take me. I have a degree in psychology and this isn't my first, or fifth run of this. I know what to say to stay out. But this is the first time a family member has called. I don't want to go. It won't help or change how I feel. I have an amazing therapist, psychiatrist, and Dr. I'm not emotional or desperate. I just don't want to try every day like this. Trying to look and act normal and happy. 

Yesterday my husband and mother in law told me I'm doing a shit job covering it. So what's the point anyways? I can't hide it. No one wants to hear it. I told my husband I want his support, but the only thing he will say is he is calling the police.

1631;bipolarreddit;whataboutjulian;15/04/2018;Best friend needs me and I’m not there (long post) My best friend recently moved to a new city and doesn’t know anyone. It’s ruining his mental health and I’ve been getting midnight and 1 am texts and calls from him. My boyfriend doesn’t understand that there is nothing going on and he needs someone to be there for him. I understand he doesn’t want me talking to other guys at that hour, but I’m so conflicted on helping a friend or making my boyfriend happy. No matter what I do it’s the wrong decision. When I drink and fall asleep my boyfriend will wake me up saying I got a call or text and I will be in such a confused state I will state a ridiculous lie that doesn’t even make sense. I don’t even realize what I’ve said until he starts yelling at me that I just lied to him. Last night my best friend called me twice and my boyfriend tried to wake me up and I told him some recruiter called me. It’s so outrageous and I don’t even remember saying it. This led to another fight about me lying and our relationship being put on the line. I can’t keep fighting and being the bad guy that’s ruining our relationship. No matter what I am always the one at fault. I don’t think I can survive another fight with him threatening our relationship only to wake up and get told that he still wants this. Last night I got multiple texts and calls from my best friend begging for me to talk to him and he needs someone there. My boyfriend grabbed the iPad and FaceTimed him and told him to stop calling me and hung up. I was a wreck crying my heart out in our bedroom. I wanted to lock myself in the closet and call my friend and be there for him but we were in the middle of battling out whether I’m lying or he wants this and how I was the one who needed to fix it. I woke up this morning and had a text from my friend telling me he had been cutting himself all night thanks to me. Why do I tell people I’ll be there for them when clearly I can’t keep the promise? I’ve let yet another close friend down. I can’t keep letting people get close to me. I ruin every relationship I’ve formed with people because I can’t keep my own life in check. I feel like the scum of the earth who doesn’t deserve a damn thing. I want to make everyone happy at what ever cost and don’t think about the reality of it. I want to rewind time and start everything over again and make it right. At this point I get to keep riding the spiral farther and father down. I could really use a high right now because this low keeps getting worse and worse. ;1997;59;439;23;39;635;221;523

I have been having a growing identity crisis lately. Once I was diagnosed, my life was based around understanding my illness. Then it was about treating it. Then it became about  maintaining it. Now that I've been maintaining it for nearly two years, I feel like I've completely lost myself in the process. 

I am on disability so don't work, live in a rural town so don't have a big social circle, and I used to get into a lot of different artsy projects, but since getting on my current med cocktail that actually seems to work, I've lost all drive and desire to be creative. I even pulled my art bag out in the hopes that I would want to pick things up and get messy...but nothing. I ended up putting it behind the end table in my living room so it is out of the way. 

I spend my days exercising, taking care of my dog, cat and husband, my house, cooking and watching tv/movies. And while I am a genuine cinephile - it's not enough; I feel so empty. Nothing about my life feels worth while anymore. I can't tell my husband before I sort this feeling out because he'll take it personally and I cannot handle that kind of conflict right now. 


I literally cried myself to sleep last night (though that was provoked because right now my husband is sick with an infection for over a week and he can get a little brash when he doesn't feel well...I try not to take it personally, because it's not personal, it just can hit the right/wrong buttons). When I was showering today I was listening to music, and the song ""Try"" came on, and when Colbie Caillat sang ""You don't have to try so hard"" I just lost it. There was no trigger this time except the song. 

I've always really been interested in and invested in politics, but the way that politics have been for the last two years, I just feel like it is adding this constant weight to my heart. I am so so sad to see what has happened to our country. Everything feels like it's getting worse and I can't see the good happening in the world, anymore. So that hobby has become a very heavy emotional weight. 


I just....I just feel empty and I don't know what to do. I don't know who I am other than a woman on disability with bipolar.

The depression I’m experiencing has been a slow onset over a few weeks, but has been really bad. My boyfriend says I’ve been fucked since New Years, idk know if I believe that, maybe. I feel so god awful alone. I haven’t felt this alone in such a long time, and my boyfriend just took me to pick out my engagement ring. My boyfriend doesn’t “get” this sort of stuff and doesn’t even try, but I’ve isolated myself so badly he’s all I’ve got to talk to (I’m convinced no one else cares, and I’m convinced he doesn’t want to put up with my shit anyways). He gets very mad. I usually have to beg him to listen, then when he finally does, he’ll say things like “don’t do that” “just do what you have to do”. I try to talk to him but he says all I do is tell him what he does wrong, which in my opinion isn’t accurate, my only gripe with our relationship has been communication and always has been. We’re bad at it together.

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Everything is such a fucking chore. I hate going to university (I’m in my mid twenties) because I feel so alone. Like those movie scenes where the person is standing still, but there are thousands of people moving around them very quickly. Like I know I don’t have anything in common with the kids at school, but since the depression has onset it’s only magnified how utterly alone I feel.

I can’t let go of the feeling that I fuck everything up. I have to beg my boyfriend to listen to me and that’s always a fight. I’ve missed assignments in school and I feel like I’m trashing it (really though, nothing major, not in danger of failing). I’m just a piece of shit, the same piece of shit I’ve always been. I ruin every good thing I touch.

I wish I didn’t care that I had to beg him to care about me sometimes, I think he is just more aloof than I am at any given time. I wish I could care less.

We're working hard to increase the diversity of our entry pool and give good writers the exposure they deserve. I know /r/BipolarReddit isn't technically a ""writers' subreddit,"" but in the past some of our strongest entries have come from subs like this one, which ostensibly have nothing to do with writing.

Long story short the drugstore that provides my prescription fucked it up and I took medication that triggered hypomania. Luckily its the weekend now and I can keep it simple. I slept 1.5 hrs the last two nights. My gf is concerned as I've been distant but really im just trying to shield her. I was supposed to hang out with people and cancelled bc of this shit and ppl are annoyed. I've shut myself in my room and will only allow my roommate (who also has a mental illness) to see me. I work out in the gym in my apartment building and return to my room. I get anxiety attacks and vomit, my hypersexuality is out of control, the voices want me to be destructive, as a release I suppose. So I've been pouring myself out on reddit and doing lots of art. Fuck this is not easy. I am being vigilant; these are the times I hurt myself and other people and make very bad decisions. My whole body is buzzing and the thoughts won't stop. I've been working out three times a day to try to tire myself out and shut my mind off. I've scrubbed every inch of the apartment. Vigorous cleaning and organizing is always a tip-off that I am in a hypomanic cycle. Going to do some yoga before bed. I keep telling myself its a process and it will take time before I can retrain my brain and body to continue to choose helpful coping. My body is so amped and my mind racing, I want someone to tranquillize me and let me sleep for 100 years. Grateful this isn't my norm anymore. A sad and worn bean. Its fucked up because some friends tell me they are jealous of me bc of how I look and the attention I receive, how social they perceive me to be but what the fuck is that worth when your brain hates you and wants you to die. Anyway I know this will pass ugh";1397;52;274;17;27;462;195;355

1651;bipolarreddit;Wombat_33;15/01/2018;"Not bipolar. Asking for advice about my daughters mother who is bipolar. Hi. 
Need to clarify that I am using my wife's account to ask this question. I'm not a person who likes or enjoys social media (I'm an old fart) so please understand I'm only borrowing her account for this. Thank you. 

I hope someone can help me out with something I need to know. 

When my ex (daughters mom) is dealing with a common cold or flu she tends to go into almost a bipolar mania with borderline psychotic actions. She lashes out verbally and sadly physically. Last time a week ago she physically went after our 10 year old daughter. I had to drive to her house after my daughter called me terrified locked in the bathroom as her mother was kicking at the door. I have my daughter now, getting her therapy, and have a 3 year no contact order for my daughter and I against her mother. 

So when my ex gets sick with normal winter illnesses why does she spiral downward like this.? 

Then she blames anyone and everyone that it was there fault. My daughter was asked if she could go and get her mother a glass of water and my daughter said ok but could you please wait a few minutes so I can finish up my last bit of homework. Normally anyone would be ok thank you but not my ex. She started breaking things and basically telling our daughter that she doesn't care about mom and doesn't care about mom being sick and then into saying what did I ever do to you to make you hate me, just a glass of water and you couldn't even be responsible and respectful enough to go get it. 

Now my daughter is not a child that yells back or gets defiant (yet lol she's at least 2 years away from the hormones) and my daughter is very soft spoken and would help anyone who asked. Complete opposite of my ex thank the heavens. 

Plus my ex goes off and on meds for the last 14 years. She says she doesn't have a problem and if she did meds cure it and ya da all gone. 

Please help me understand the correlation between bipolar and colds/flus with a person who cycles back and forth and refuses meds then goes back on for roughly a month no more than that every few years. 

Thank you 


Update edit: 
For the record I don't plan on keeping the PFA order no contact for 3 years. That's what the judge ruled. I just wanted it for 3 months but with supervised visits for a few weeks leading into an actual custody order for my ex to have our daughter 50/50. But because ex was arrested (swinging at a cop and it was neighbors who called unbeknownst to me until the next day) the judge ruled this way. Yes I wanted to just get her out of my daughters life because I was extremely angry for a few years. It was for me. Not my daughter. It was so I could feel better. Thanks to my wife she's changed my view on how it shouldn't be a selfish want or desire. I had to think about my daughter AND my ex and how it wouldn't be a good thing for either of them if I stopped their relationship. So I apologize to everyone on here for being a jerk. My wife said I was being one lol ";2380;82;472;29;46;771;260;604

I felt i was out of that dark cell in my mind. No more tasting the black that had become me. The sudden surge of electrons through my being gave me a pleasurable headache and brought stinging tears to my eyes... 

It felt better than stabbing myself   i felt better than real. I surmise this is what maybe those other ones feel. I have tears streaming down my face as i right this. Knowing im missspelling as i go and so on.

1653;bipolarreddit;WorkingAction;28/01/2018;"Sleep-talking and Restlessness with Bipolar Disorder? I've struggled with Bipolar Disorder for years. I'm almost 20, and I notice a lot that I end up sleep talking. I've had a couple occasions where I wake up in the middle of the night and I start having a conversation with one of my friends, just like I would do at any other point in the day. I would feel like my friend is sitting in the chair in the corner of my room just having a conversation with me in the dark, and I will wake up and talk for a couple of minutes (what it seems like at least) before I seem to pull out of it and freak out a little when I realize that it wasn't real.

It gets WAY worse when my boyfriend sleeps over at my apartment. When I used to stay at my ex's house as well, I remember sleep-talking over there.

When my boyfriend slept over last week, I had at least 4 instances within the night of tossing and turning where I started having nightmares, and then talking through them. There were a couple points in the night where I ""woke up"" and shook my boyfriend on the shoulder and started talking to him like he was my old best friend Shelby. I began talking to ""Shelby"" about how our friendship had been on the rocks but we should try and be best friends again. He was mostly sound asleep and wrapped his arms around me and I remember thinking ""Oh, that's not Shelby"" right before I fell back into a short, but deep sleep.

It happened with another nightmare that same night, I woke up crying and saying ""I don't know why you would do this, why did you have to do that? Why did you cheat on me? You know loyalty is so important to me,"" because in my dream I guess my boyfriend had been unfaithful or something, and I was in the in-between of asleep and awake and I started lecturing my very-faithful boyfriend on why he dream-cheated on me (lol). But after a minute of talking to him (he's a heavy sleeper, so he didn't really fully listen right away to what I was saying), I snap out of it almost every time, even just a little bit and realize that I wasn't actually having a convo with anyone.

It's a really bizarre scenario, and it's happened a few times.

Another one I can specifically think of included sleep walking and sleep talking at my ex's house. I started having a full-on conversation at 3 am after having been sound asleep, and I started talking about how I wanted to watch the movie School of Rock (idk why haha). 

It's hard because it's not a full-on sleeptalking I don't think. I have a weird experience where in the moment, I am aware that I am having a conversation, even though I think my body is about 10% aware that the people I am talking to are just from my dreams. It's so strange. I'm sorry if this is confusing, but if anyone has any experience with intense &amp; regular sleep-talking, please do share!!";2210;79;447;27;31;710;230;561

1655;bipolarreddit;wowwww321;17/01/2018;"Zoloft inducing hypomaniA Hi guys. ive recently (11 days ago) started the antidepressant Zoloft, and it caused a hypomanic episode that lasted about 4 days. Let me just say, I have never felt so great in my life. It was such a relief from depression I just can't explain it.

so on the last day of the hypomanic episode at night I smoked some weed, and the next day it was gone. I don't know if the weed caused that or not. My question here is, do you think it would be possible to come off the antidepressants for a week, then start them again so I can experience that high again? or maybe try some other AD's?

Yes, I understand this isn't healthy as such, but I would do just about anything to experience that again. Please, if you have any knowledge or ideas with regard to this I would love you forever.

I'm not necessarily afraid of failure, but it seems like that's all that can happen to me. It's getting really hard to keep going when all I'm ever met with is disappointment.

I'm caught in this stranglehold: the manic side of me sees all this potential and what I can be if I put my mind to it, but I always fall short and that just further verifies what the depressed side of me feels(that I'm not worth much of anything and I have no real way of making my life better.)

It leaves me with no motivation to even try to do better because it's always ended the same way.

I feel like I'm running out of time to get my life in order and I don't even really have a clue what to do with my life.

Bipolar 2 here. I just switched off of Abilify to Rexulti to combat some depression issues I was having. Psych told me Rexulti would be stronger in that regard. Also on Lamictal and Effexor. I think that’s actually all I’m on, as I weened off a few others (Ritalin, Straterra, Vistaril). Anyway: I used to function really well at my old job. I worked in shipping and did well enough to be promoted to a manager position when the company grew a bit. I threw it away because the money was not worth it even though I was mostly happy. Fast forward 18 months and I’ve had this new job at an insurance broker for 11 months. I work in the billing department. It’s a great job, with great coworkers, good pay, and strong benefits. I stumbled a bit a month or so ago. Took an entire month off work to try and fix myself. Back to work with a great accommodation: working from home. However, I cannot focus well enough to get my work load done. Even if I give my SO anything I would use to distract myself, I just stare at the computer and space out. Boom. 40-50 minutes go by and it feels like a couple seconds. I’m starting to get paranoid about being fired for lack of progress. Which makes it even harder to focus. I need help. I go to therapy, consistently take my meds, but I just can’t seem to get over this hurdle and I need to. I have a family to take care of.

She were there for me the whole time, but things worked out in a way that I developed a crush on her. I really thought ""wtf, mania. Again?"". But I had my lithium tests, talked to my psychiatrist and sadly I wasn't manic at all. I was really suffering, because she has her problems too and when I try to talk with her about it she doesn't respond well. I tried do keep my distance, try to get over it, but she likes me a lot and we became even closer. 
Relationships are a huge problem for me, and my friend is in a different phase of life. She broke with her first boyfriend recently (they were together from age 13 till 18, church boyfriend, holding hands only, she was unhappy) and now she is dating a lot of guys no strings attached, a lot like what I do, but it hurts for me to see it. I started avoiding being at the same places she goes to and the others close to me are telling me she is not really all that.  So I decided to put our friendship on a hold too, since I'm unhappy with this ""let's speed date everyone we can and maybe we'll get together at the end"". I can't keep having sex and making out with strangers to compensate her actions, you know? It became toxic. Yesterday we've had a huge fight about it, because I told her I didn't like to be exposed this way.

I have done extensive research and I am 100% sure I don't have any of the various types of bipolar disorder. I have never had a manic episode, and most of the symptoms I've read about have not occurred to me. I would really appreciate some advice or anecdotes regarding those who were put on Lamictal but do not have a bipolar diagnosis.** 

I have been on various depression medications over the course of 15 years, and till trying to find medications that work for me. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder (including Panic Disorder), Depression, and PTSD. Every day, I experience depression for most of the day, and lately, my baseline of anxiety is high all the time, and at times has spiked so high that I have had mood swings (which is very uncommon for me). But the thing is, my mood swings from being depressed to being angry, irritated or just so unhappy and overwhelmed that I cry. Not happy or excitable. 

The medications I'm on are Gabapentin (prescribed for a chronic pain disorder, not depression), Wellbutrin &amp; Buspar; I am convinced the Buspar is not doing enough for my anxiety, but this week my doc increased my dose to 3 times a day ""to give it one last shot"". Then he said he wanted to add Lamictal into my daily routine because it would help with my mood swings. He didn't really explain much more than that. I told him I didn't feel like the mood swings were my problem because they are being caused by my anxiety, which is not being controlled.

**Does this story sound familiar to anyone? Should I lose my skepticism and just give Lamictal a shot? Does my doctor think I have bipolar depression and isn't telling me?**  This post is in no way meant to avoid a true diagnosis from my doctor.

*First off, this is a cross post from r/bipolar and I hope that’s allowed! If not, please remove!*


Do any of you feel like your interest in relationships comes and goes with your mood swings? I am shit at maintaining (romantic) relationships. It’s like my feelings for a person are *completely* out of my control. I’ll start dating someone new usually when I’m manic, and I’ll be borderline obsessed with them, and then my depression hits and BAM, time to dump them! Suddenly I don’t care about them at all anymore, and that scares me because of course they’re lovely people who have shared in great times with me. But suddenly I don’t want anything to do with them, get out of my life please, thank you.


I have managed to retain friendships with a few of these people, but the others I pretty much just booted from my life, and they were completely blind-sighted and hurt. I feel awful for doing this, but it’s like I can’t stop, and every time I date someone new I think, *maybe this time I won’t do it.*


My friends and family don’t take me seriously at all anymore. If I mention someone I’m seeing they make comments like, “Yeah, we’ll see how long this one lasts haha.” One friend even told me I should just stop dating altogether! I don’t want to give up on having meaningful romantic relationships in my life! I am human. But I feel like a complete joke. It doesn’t help that I’m prone to rapid cycling so these relationships can be anywhere from a few weeks to a couple months. I go through long periods of staying single and having zero interest in romantic relationships (usually when I’m depressed, but not exclusively - I’ve just never been very relationship-oriented), but a huge part of my mania manifests as uncontrollable sexual appetite, so I always end up dating around at that point.


It’s gotten to the point where I feel like I need a disclaimer when I enter into a new relationship! I’ve tried gently telling people that I’m a bit flighty but then they’re constantly waiting for me to leave and that doesn’t really seem productive either. I’m just tired of hurting people and repeating this cycle, but I don’t want to just give up on dating altogether. Anyone else? Am I alone here?

1674;bipolarreddit;youhadtime;27/02/2018;"Back to the psychiatrist... I sat in the parking lot outside of work today and finally made another appointment with my psychiatrist after three months of quitting medication. I'm so tired of feeling depressed and *angry* and nauseous and paranoid. I'm in a mixed episode and my method of keeping my head down and waiting it out isn't working well for me.

Music sounds strange. Voices and lights are overwhelming. Road rage spills out of me and I'm horrified but unable to stop...and when I'm not behind the wheel my feet drag, I have trouble focusing, every small task a huge ordeal. I haven't cooked in weeks -- I'm either overeating or not eating at all -- and I'm spending way too much money on delivery and drive-thru's. I'm anxious and irritable and bitter and hopeless and yet I know, logically, that I have no reason to feel this way.

I was on medication for six months before I stopped taking everything cold turkey. The lamotragine and wellbutrin had helped a lot at first when I was in a similar state last spring, but I wasn't convinced that I needed them anymore (or that my bipolar diagnosis was even accurate) and I was a couple of weeks away from losing my insurance indefinitely.

It's been a whirlwind of a winter. I went through it all:

Euphoric hypomania around the holidays. Huge spending, not sleeping or eating, hanging out with everybody, falling in love, lots of drinking and partying and being merry. I could so easily sink karaoke in front of hundreds of my coworkers at the holiday party or confess my love for my best friend or *be curiously spontaneous*. 

Followed by a crash. Depression. Self medicating. Waking up with a feeling of dread. Not wanting to leave the house, go to work, get out of bed. I quit my food industry job, stopped hanging out with friends, stopped replying to texts and calls.

Started feeling better for a week or two before *bam* here we are. Mixed episode.

I'm not looking forward to tomorrow. I don't want to be on medication or accept that I have bipolar, but I'm willing to try if it gets me out of this horribly distressing mess. I don't know where to start except to post here and not be in the dark about what I've been going through these past few months (as well as the past decade). And I'm fortunate to have a wonderful psychiatrist. It helps with going back.

1681;bipolarreddit;ywkwpwnw;18/04/2018;"I got a new job! My greatest accomplishment was passing the state electrical exam with ADD but with the help of Ritalin. After being laid off from work several times because of being bipolar I went through depression which caused me to want to quit the trade. I have had a divorce from the field and don't want to be an electrician anymore. 

Hit with child support I found myself without a job for a long time. I worried I was going to jail for non payment and finally found a job at McDonald's making $7.25 an hour at 10 hours a week. Not enough to pay child support. 

I responded to an ad for a job remodeling fire/smoke/water damaged houses and aced my interview. I got the call today on the job offer. $11 an hour at 40+ hours a week. I went from $200/mo to $1760/mo. 

I used to make $4000/mo. But I'm happy I can finally pay my bills. Being jobless, a felon, a divorcée and not having filed my taxes since 2012 had me in crippling depression. I've since found a website I could file everything and will be doing that soon so I won't go to federal prison for tax dodging. 

After years of drug abuse with alcoholism I have also been sober three years.

1682;bipolarreddit;Zajren;31/03/2018;"Rant, I Guess. Hello, sorry this is my first time actually posting on Reddit so I'm feeling a little nervous, but it's all good.

I'm a freshman in college, and last October I finally saw a psychiatrist after years of struggling and got diagnosed with Bipolar 2, GAD, panic disorder and social anxiety. We decided to try lithium and two other anxiety meds. I actually overdosed on the anxiety meds although I was taking the amount I was told and was having a lot of pain for like a few weeks, so I wasn't really able to focus in my classes; I got pretty behind and almost left on med leave. I'm now on Gabapentin and got started on Lamotrigine.

I guess the lithium was working for a while, but lately I have felt like an absolute mess. I will be in what feels like hypomania in the morning and be running around, talking a mile a minute, everything, and then just get hit with depression and withdraw from everyone. Or vice versa. And this sometimes happens multiple times a day. I'm starting to feel crazy and it is taking everything that I have to just barely function, nevermind actually having time to do homework or other responsibilities. I don't know what to do with myself. 

I just feel so terrible. It just feels like I can't achieve any sort of sane moment because if I'm not being affected by my BD, my anxiety is at a 10. I just want to be calm and stable. 

I am just afraid of this starting to affect my family and my boyfriend. He is the most understanding person I have ever met, but I feel like eventually, he is going to get exhausted with me. I'm not a very happy person and I don't understand why anyone would want to spend time with me.

I don't know anyone around here with BD and it is making me feel really alone, which is why I guess I decided to make this post. I just feel so crazy, I don't know. I'm sorry.

1683;bipolarreddit;zappmusic;17/02/2018;"Boy did I screw up Wow. Did I mess up. 

A little background. Diagnosed as bipolar at 18 after a difficult junior high and high school experience. Struggled throughout my early 20s and finally got my life under control by my late 20s. Met an amazing woman and got married. Managed to find a meaningful career and had a few years of amazing success. Two wonderful kids. 

About 4 years ago my career started going south. There are several reasons, one of which was a move to different state then most of my freelance work. My wife also got very sick when pregnant with our second child and I ended up getting into a bad pattern of care taking without taking care of myself. Especially when it came to sleep. 

As the money stopped coming in, I started selling some stocks that I owned prior to our relationship. I ended up selling almost all of it and cashing out the majority of our small but important IRA over the course of 2-3 years. I never shared any of this with my wife and never reported any of the money as income. 

Fast forward to 2017. Almost all of the stock is gone (and I still haven’t told anyone). We are practically broke and borrowing money from family members repeatedly. A few weeks ago my wife demanded access to my brokerage account. She decided the best way to fix our finances was for her to take complete control. The jig was up. My huge violation of trust was revealed. 

I truly believe that deep down I am a good person. I have a good heart and I am a very caring and loving father and husband. But with my terrible actions and hiding and lying about it, it is clear that I am sick and need help. I don’t know what caused this manic episode, but I am sure the fact that I sleep 5-6 hours a night so she can get a full 8-10 hours of sleep every day didn’t help. 

She says she loves me, but hates my guts right now. She says she loves me but is terrified and feels like unsafe. She says she doesn’t know if she can stand to have me in the house or will ever be able to see me as a romantic partner again. 

I haven’t been in therapy since my psych died in 2011. I’ve been seeing a nurse practitioner once every three months to keep my prescriptions up. But clearly need to find a new doctor pronto and get intensive therapy. Not just medication management. 

If I didn’t have children, I can’t imagine what I’d do to myself. But I love them and I love her so much. I know I have a chronic illness and this is a major “flare up.” I just can’t imagine how I can live without my family.

We are seeing a couples therapist next week. I am so ashamed of my actions and my lying. I’m not sure what to do. ";2050;75;399;33;46;685;271;521

1685;bipolarreddit;zefcashi;08/03/2019;"SO in need of help We have been together with break ups for 7 years. 
2 years ago we moved for a fresh start but I feel it was to get me away from friends and family as all I have is him now. He also now has little support. 
I am scared for my safety and though I love him I can't do this to myself no more. I want children and a house and this feels like it'll never happen. 
We have moved countless times from him damaging the houses or putting us in financial debt that we are then kicked out. We have been homeless from him not being able to accept help and choosing drugs. 
My jobs have been comprised from him going into work and abusing me having police show up or I become sick from no sleep or malnourished or crazy depressed. 
He is in and out of work for his family but really is just a pay cheque and he never goes to work so has no routine. Especially now days. 
I've had many police involvements and hospitalized from them and other times. 
This past year and a half has been nothing but a downward spiral and I feel I am an enabler and he does better without me because he has to stand on his own two feet when I'm not there. I feel like a mother more than a partner. 
Our current house is trashed inside and out. Actual mess and filth to house damage aswell.
He recently got out of hospital but his mania is still very high up. He spent all our pay on material things, drugs and the likes and we now have to paid rent that I'm aware of for 2 weeks. He goes out at all hours night driving around and from this his car has been in multiple crashes but won't tell me any details so we can't get insurance. It's still half drivable but suspended and I'm worried of him driving my car. 
I have most of my belongings in my car as he has said he will light the house in fire before being hospitalized and did try. 
I am extremely mentally drainage from all this and the way I am spoken to constantly. I am walking on egg shells and get no sleep as he hardly sleeps and does many OCD things to wake me up like flicking lights, rummaging through draws. Half organising or cleaning at inappropriate hours of the night. Physically waking me up to harrass me when his not driving around. I know his taken his meds and the hospital and docs just won't believe me that he isn't fine and his meds currently don't work anymore.  
I am sorry for the mess of this post. Hard to put 7 years of a very stressful realtionships in words and currently what's happening. 
How do I get out? I feel I have spent majority of the years trying so hard to help and also been a bad guy and an enabler which makes it hard too. But it gets harder and harder to see a future and happiness. 
I am scared he will try to hurt himself or follow me if I try.  
Any advice I'd be so greatful for. ";2173;67;461;33;45;710;254;564

1688;bipolarreddit;zhombeh;22/02/2019;"needing validation ive never posted on this subreddit before because i am not officially diagnosed bipolar, but i went from MDD to an unspecified mood disorder in less than a year. some bg: im a college sophomore. the first time i ever went to therapy was march of last year. i started lamictal in december. growing up mental illness was just not a thing to my parents, so i never saw any doctor or pdoc.

basically, ive had to do and learn everything myself regarding mental illness and treatment. but i think im reaching a burnout. the lamictal is great, however my focus issues, which ill just address as ADHD (i have vivid memories of almost never sleeping during pre-school nap time and instead lifting up our bed mats with my legs, and ive heard my mom say she has it) are still something i don't have treatment for.


not being diagnosed with anything as a kid has made this journey incredibly difficult, especially concering ADHD. while ive improved drastically since freshman year (i had a debilitating depressive episode where i ended up with a 0.8 GPA), i haven't made progress with the ADHD. last friday i went to an ADHD screening for testing at my school's psych services office as im required to have the school's insurance anyways. it was the most discouraging experience.

i told the woman that ive had focus issues and homework issues for as long as i can remember.  i told her exactly what my thoughts would be like in a class, my horrible sleep quality, my difficulties around getting my work done, etc. i talked to her about the very recent development regarding my mood disorder.

she told me that she thinks what i was describing is related to other issues, which were ""out of their scope"" and recommended me to a doctor who has a semester long waitlist for full psychological testing. which would be at least $400, $4,000 if i didnt have insurance. 

last semester i dealt with ADHD by meeting with a professor every week to go over assignments. i got accommodations from a few classes even without being registered with disability services. however, that's not 100% the case with all my classes this semester. i was struggling before that screening but now im struggling even more. i have a test tomorrow morning i have not studied for, not to mention i did not do at all an essay assignment, and i havent done the workbook pages due by the test. i had to ask for an extension for a paper in another class the night before because i hadn't even written it. ive missed meetings and work.

that friday night i tried to find coke. sunday night i took 5 shots at 1am. monday i bought adderall and took 3/4 of it, and ive never taken adderall before. i have not done anything but stay in bed because the thought of even trying to tackle my immense amount of work is so overwhelming. 

i know it takes a while to get a diagnosis but like i said, i am feeling so burnt out. how many more doctors do i have to see? how many more episodes do i have to go through and other self-destructive behaviour? my family is no help either, my father threatened to not pay my tuition when he found out i was taking meds and refused to tell him. the rest are just invalidating. 

i don't know what to do or figure out what i need to find out. i am so tired of not having anything. my chest literally hurts and im curled up in bed in the dark crying. im sorry this is so long but ive never had the chance or resource to really talk about this stuff honestly that im just letting it all out now. im just desperate for some reassurance and validation at the very least.";2835;128;509;64;46;952;312;686

I’m just amazed by how reliably I get these symptoms in the spring/summer. This year I started having hypomanic symptoms the last week of March. That’s the EXACT same time I started getting hypomanic symptoms a couple years ago for my first big manic episode.

 It doesn’t happen every year in spring, summer ones are more spread out, but it’s very interesting how tightly it is associated with the change in the season.

Do any of you also notice the same thing?
